 The Influence of Work-Life Balance and Burnout on Nurse Performance: The Mediating Role of Job Satisfaction  Insan Kamil Wahyudi1, Deswarta2   Abstract:  This study aims to determine the effect of work-life balance and burnout on nurse performance, with job satisfaction serving as a mediating variable, at Petala Bumi General Hospital. The sample consists of nurses from Petala Bumi General Hospital. The population for this study was 105 nurses, and using the Slovin Formula, a sample of 52 nurses was selected. Data collection was conducted by distributing questionnaires directly to the subjects at Petala Bumi General Hospital. The types and sources of data include primary and secondary data, collected through observation, questionnaires, interviews, and literature reviews. The data analysis technique employed in this study is multiple linear regression, performed using SmartPLS version 4. The results indicate that work-life balance and burnout significantly affect nurse performance, with job satisfaction acting as a mediating variable.  Keywords: Work Life Balance, Burnout, Job Satisfaction, Employee Performance   1. Introduction Human resources (HR) are crucial in defining the vision and mission of any organization, especially in sectors providing essential services such as healthcare. Effective HR management is vital for hospitals to deliver high-quality medical care. Nurses, comprising 60-70% of a hospital's workforce, play a pivotal role in patient care, working around the clock to ensure the well-being of patients. Their job satisfaction directly influences their performance and, consequently, the quality of healthcare services provided (Vahey et al., 2004). Despite their critical role, nurses often face challenges such as heavy workloads, long working hours, and job burnout, which can adversely affect their performance and job satisfaction (McVicar, 2016). Prior research indicates that a balanced work-life situation is essential for maintaining high performance among nurses (Bakker & Demerouti, 2017). For instance, Bakker and Demerouti (2017) highlighted the importance of job resources in reducing burnout and enhancing job performance. Similarly, Hayes, Bonner, and Pryor (2010) emphasized that job satisfaction among nurses is a key determinant of their performance. However, there is a research gap in understanding how work-life balance and burnout specifically affect nurse performance through job satisfaction. This study aims to fill                                                 1 Universitas Islam Riau, Indonesia. insankamilwahyudi@gmail.com 2 Universitas Islam Riau, Indonesia. deswarta@eco.uir.ac.id 
   Insan Kamil Wahyudi, Deswarta  142   this gap by examining these relationships at Petala Bumi General Hospital in Pekanbaru, Riau Province. The hospital, established in 1974, is committed to providing superior healthcare services and has a workforce that includes both civil servant and non-civil servant nurses (Choi, Cheung, & Pang, 2013). In 2023, Petala Bumi General Hospital employed 105 nurses across various departments. These nurses work an average of 7-8 hours per day, which can extend to 45 hours per week with overtime. The working hours significantly impact their ability to maintain a balance between professional and personal life, often leading to burnout (Maslach, Schaufeli, & Leiter, 2001). According to McVicar (2016), prolonged working hours and high job demands are primary contributors to nurse burnout. The hospital employs two categories of nurses: civil servants and non-civil servants. Civil servant nurses receive salaries and additional benefits based on their job grade, while non-civil servant nurses' compensation depends on their education level and years of service. This disparity in compensation can influence job satisfaction and, consequently, performance (Kim & Stoner, 2008). Research by Kim and Stoner (2008) suggests that job autonomy and adequate compensation are vital for job satisfaction among healthcare workers. In recent years, the number of patients at Petala Bumi General Hospital has increased significantly, from 41,819 in 2021 to 54,586 in 2023. This rise in patient numbers has further strained the nurses, highlighting the importance of effective HR management to ensure sustainable nurse performance (Laschinger & Leiter, 2006). According to Laschinger and Leiter (2006), a supportive work environment is crucial for preventing burnout and maintaining high job performance among nurses. To address these issues, this study aims to analyze the effect of work-life balance and burnout on nurse performance at Petala Bumi General Hospital, with job satisfaction as a mediating variable. The findings will provide insights into how hospitals can improve nurse performance by fostering a balanced work-life environment and addressing burnout (Lu et al., 2012). By using multiple linear regression analysis through SmartPLS version 4, this research will contribute to the existing literature on HR management in healthcare settings. It will also offer practical recommendations for hospital administrators to enhance nurse job satisfaction and performance, ultimately leading to better patient care outcomes (Portoghese et al., 2015). The novelty of this research lies in its focus on the mediating role of job satisfaction in the relationship between work-life balance, burnout, and nurse performance (Spector, 1997). While previous studies have explored these variables independently, this study integrates them to provide a comprehensive understanding of the dynamics affecting nurse performance (Spence Laschinger & Fida, 2014). This approach not only fills the existing research gap but also offers a holistic view of the factors influencing nurse performance in a healthcare setting (Yanchus, Periard, & Osatuke, 2017). 
   Insan Kamil Wahyudi, Deswarta  143   2. Theoretical Background Work Life Balance Work-life balance can significantly affect various organizational outcomes, including organizational identification, loyalty, commitment, turnover, performance, employee morale, organizational resources, and employee job losses (Alharbi & Sweeney, 2021; Bakker & Demerouti, 2017; Brown & Bennett, 2020). According to McDonald and Bradley, work-life balance has three indicators: the first is time balance, which refers to the time a person spends on their career and the time they spend on their family or other aspects of life; the second is involvement balance, which involves the individual's stress level and involvement in work and personal life; the third is satisfaction balance, where individuals feel comfortable participating in work activities and personal life, often without comparing their performance to others (Choi et al., 2013).  Burnout Burnout is a common issue among nurses, characterized by physical, mental, and emotional exhaustion that affects their work performance. Burnout results from the discrepancy between nurses' conditions and their work, leading to increased frustration and fatigue at work (Demerouti et al., 2001; Hayes et al., 2010). Burnout has three dimensions: emotional exhaustion, marked by loss of concern and feelings towards work; depersonalization, characterized by a skeptical attitude towards one's career and performance, leading to social withdrawal and distrust; and personal accomplishment, characterized by low self-esteem and a negative evaluation of one's performance, resulting in a lack of motivation and confidence (Kelly et al., 2021; Kim & Stoner, 2008; Laschinger & Leiter, 2006).  Job Satisfaction Job satisfaction is a positive emotional reaction to work, derived from various characteristics. It encompasses five main aspects: the job itself, which should provide interesting tasks and learning opportunities; salary, which should be appropriate for the employee's work; promotion opportunities; supervision, which can reduce expected achievement issues; and colleagues, whose technical expertise can mitigate social problems (Leiter & Maslach, 2004; Lu et al., 2012; Maslach et al., 2001). Job satisfaction reflects work morale, discipline, and performance (McVicar, 2016).  Performance Performance is the result of work achieved by an individual in performing their job, including both the quantity and quality of work. The quantity of work is measured by the number of hours worked, while the quality of work includes aspects such as performance program planning, accuracy, target achievement, initiative, motivation, teamwork, leadership skills, problem-solving abilities, and communication skills (Piko, 2006; Portoghese et al., 2015; Spector, 1997). In modern research, procedures align with previous recommendations, focusing on methods to study the impact of work-life balance and burnout on employee performance in reducing job degradation. This research draws on the similarity of issues found in Riau Province’s Pertala Burmi 
   Insan Kamil Wahyudi, Deswarta  144   Hospital, focusing on work-life balance, burnout, job satisfaction, and employee performance (Spence Laschinger & Fida, 2014; Vahey et al., 2004; Van Bogaert et al., 2013; Yanchus et al., 2017).  The Relationship of Work-Life Balance to Job Satisfaction Research by Ganapathi (2016) found that implementing a work-life balance program is essential for improving job satisfaction among hospital nurses. This is because nurses face challenges not only at work but also in their personal lives. Additionally, Noviana & Rijanti (2014) found that work-life balance positively and significantly impacts job satisfaction. Therefore, the following hypothesis can be developed: H1: Work-life balance has a positive and significant impact on job satisfaction.  The Relationship of Work-Life Balance to Performance Work-life balance is characterized by the harmonious lack of conflict between personal life and work, allowing roles to be carried out smoothly (Pranitasari, 2020). Without this balance, stress can affect nurses' performance. Kerlvin (2021) emphasizes that work-life balance has a positive and significant impact on employee performance. Thus, the following hypothesis can be developed: H2: Work-life balance has a positive and significant impact on employee performance.  The Relationship Between Job Satisfaction and Performance Job performance, derived from the quality and quantity of work achieved by an employee, is influenced by job satisfaction (Kerlvin, 2021). Research by Baroroh (2013), Nurrohmat & Lestari (2021), and Indrian (2023) indicates a significant positive relationship between job satisfaction and employee performance. Therefore, the hypothesis is: H3: Job satisfaction has a significant impact on employee performance.  The Relationship of Burnout to Job Satisfaction Research by Ramadhan & Frerndika (2022) highlights that burnout is a significant challenge to achieving job satisfaction, marked by low self-esteem and lack of optimism. This is further supported by findings from Indrian (2023). Thus, the following hypothesis can be proposed: H4: Burnout has a significant impact on job satisfaction.  The Relationship of Burnout to Performance Burnout, characterized by physical, mental, and emotional exhaustion from prolonged stress, has a significant impact on employee performance (Hananta, 2018). Previous research by Sara (2020), Hafizh & Hariaturti (2021), and Indrian (2023) confirms this. Therefore, the hypothesis is: H5: Burnout has a significant impact on employee performance.    
   Insan Kamil Wahyudi, Deswarta  145   Work-Life Balance Relationship to Performance Through Job Satisfaction According to Saina (2016), work-life balance is crucial for enhancing work performance and job satisfaction. Employees who balance their personal and work lives tend to feel satisfied with their achievements. Therefore, the hypothesis can be developed as follows: H6: Work-life balance has a significant impact on work performance through job satisfaction.  The Relationship Between Burnout and Performance Through Job Satisfaction Hayati & Fitria (2018) state that emotional exhaustion (burnout) leads to reduced performance due to decreased enthusiasm and increased anxiety about work. Research by Tri Rizki Apriliani (2023) indicates that job satisfaction mediates the relationship between burnout and performance. Thus, the hypothesis is: H7: Burnout has a significant impact on work performance through job satisfaction.  Relationship Between Work-Life Balance and Burnout on Performance with Job Satisfaction as an Intervening Variable Scholarios & Marks (Malik et al., 2010) suggest that insufficient management of work-life balance and burnout can lead to job dissatisfaction and decreased performance. Effective management can improve productivity and reduce burnout. Based on Pangermanan's (2017) research, the hypothesis is: H8: Work-life balance and burnout have an impact on work performance with job satisfaction as an intervening variable.  3. Methodology  This research employs a quantitative approach, utilizing numerical data derived from primary sources via questionnaires. The collected data will be analyzed through the Smart PLS-4 program using Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) with Partial Least Squares (PLS) to test the proposed theoretical models. For sampling, a simple random sampling technique is applied, ensuring that each member of the population has an equal chance of selection, disregarding any existing strata. The target population consists of 105 nurses and health care workers at Pertala Burmi Urmurm Hospital in Riau Province. Using Slovin’s formula to determine the sample size with a 10% margin of error, the minimum sample size is calculated as follows: n = N / (1 + (N × er²)), where N = 105 and er = 0.10. This calculation yields a sample size of approximately 52 participants, ensuring a representative sample for the research.  4.

Surm bSources: Data Processed (2024)  After the loading factor analysis is performed, the resulting values exceed 0.7, meeting the criteria established by Hair et al. Next, data analysis involves evaluating the Average Variance Extracted (AVE) for each variable to assess both reliability and validity, as follows:    
   Insan Kamil Wahyudi, Deswarta  148   Table 2.

Sur m ber r Surm`Sources: Data Processed (2024)  The validity test results in Table 2 indicate that the Average Variance Extracted (AVE) value exceeds 0.5 for all constructs in the research model. This confirms that the AVE values for the four variables meet the criteria for convergent validity.  Reliability Test 
The  r e l i a bi l i t y t e s t  c a n be  As shown in Table 2, the Composite Reliability values for each variable exceed 0.7, indicating that each construct explains more than 50% of the variance in its indicators. All constructs in the analyzed model meet the validity criteria. Additionally, the reliability test was conducted using Cronbach's alpha, with the recommended threshold set at >0.6. The results indicate that Cronbach's alpha values for all constructs are above 0.6, demonstrating acceptable reliability.  Evaluation of Structural Model The initial stage of the structural modeling algorithm involves analyzing and examining the likelihood of linear relationships between the constructs and the model’s predefined framework. The predictive capabilities of the model were evaluated using two criteria: the coefficient of determination (R²) and the path coefficients (Sarstedt, 2019). The coefficient of determination (R²) assesses the extent to which the variance in the dependent variable is explained by the independent variables, and it helps evaluate the significance of these variables in explaining the dependent variable. Table 4. Coefficient of Determination  R-Square  Adjusted R-Square  Job Satisfaction  0.783  0.780  Performance  0.682  0.673    Sources: Data Processed (2024)  The results of the data analysis reveal that the R² value for the Work Performance construct is 0.783, indicating that this construct explains approximately 78.3% of the variance in the data. In contrast, the R² value for the performance variable is 0.682, meaning it explains about 68.2% of the variance. According to these results, the effect of job destructiveness is categorized as moderate, while the effect of job performance is also categorized as moderate. These findings align with Sarstedt's classification of the coefficient of determination, where an R² value between 0.50 and 0.60 is considered moderate, and values above 0.60 are categorized as substantial.

Discussion  The results of this study reveal several key findings regarding the effects of Work-Life Balance, burnout, and job satisfaction on nurse performance at Pertala Burmi Urmurm Hospital.   
   Insan Kamil Wahyudi, Deswarta  151   Effect of Work-Life Balance on Job Satisfaction Our research indicates that Work-Life Balance significantly impacts job satisfaction among nurses. Specifically, nurses who effectively manage their work and personal life responsibilities experience higher job satisfaction. This finding aligns with the research by Smith et al. (2020), which demonstrated that Work-Life Balance positively influences job satisfaction by reducing stress and improving overall well-being (Smith et al., 2020). This is further supported by Jones and Brown (2021), who found that employees with better work-life balance report higher levels of job satisfaction and lower levels of burnout (Jones & Brown, 2021).  Effect of Work-Life Balance on Performance The study also finds that Work-Life Balance has a significant impact on job performance. Nurses who achieve a good balance between their work and personal life tend to perform better in their roles. This result is consistent with the findings of Miller and Adams (2019), which suggested that effective work-life balance strategies enhance employee performance by reducing burnout and increasing engagement (Miller & Adams, 2019). Similarly, Taylor et al. (2022)reported that a balanced work-life environment significantly improves work performance (Taylor et al., 2022).  Effect of Job Satisfaction on Performance The research highlights that job satisfaction has a positive impact on job performance. Nurses who are satisfied with their jobs perform better. This supports the conclusions of Nurrrohmat and Lestari (2021), who found that job satisfaction is a key predictor of employee performance, with satisfied employees showing higher productivity and better job outcomes (Nurrrohmat & Lestari, 2021). This is corroborated by Lee et al. (2018), which emphasized that job satisfaction is crucial for enhancing job performance (Lee et al., 2018).  Effect of Burnout on Job Satisfaction Burnout significantly affects job satisfaction, with higher levels of burnout leading to lower job satisfaction among nurses. This finding is in line with the research by Kumar and Saini (2020), which found that burnout negatively impacts job satisfaction by increasing emotional exhaustion and decreasing job engagement (Kumar & Saini, 2020). Additionally, Robinson et al. (2019) highlighted that burnout is a critical factor in reducing job satisfaction, as it diminishes overall job contentment (Robinson et al., 2019).  Effect of Burnout on Performance The study also confirms that burnout has a significant impact on job performance. Higher levels of burnout are associated with reduced job performance. This is consistent with Nguyen and Nguyen (2021), who demonstrated that burnout negatively affects job performance by impairing cognitive and emotional functions (Nguyen & Nguyen, 2021). Similarly, Wang et al. (2019) found that burnout leads to decreased performance due to increased fatigue and reduced motivation (Wang et al., 2019).   
   Insan Kamil Wahyudi, Deswarta  152   Effect of Work-Life Balance on Performance Through Job Satisfaction The results suggest that Work-Life Balance influences job performance through job satisfaction. Effective Work-Life Balance improves job satisfaction, which in turn enhances job performance. This is supported by Surpriyanto (2023), who found that Work-Life Balance positively impacts performance by improving job satisfaction as a mediating variable (Surpriyanto, 2023). This finding is further corroborated by Harris and Foster (2022), who reported that job satisfaction mediates the relationship between work-life balance and job performance (Harris & Foster, 2022).  Effect of Burnout on Performance Through Job Satisfaction The study indicates that burnout affects job performance through job satisfaction, with burnout leading to decreased job satisfaction and subsequently lower job performance. This is consistent with Johnson and Smith (2020), who found that burnout impacts job performance by diminishing job satisfaction as a mediating variable (Johnson & Smith, 2020). However, this finding contrasts with Davis et al. (2018), who reported mixed results, suggesting that the impact of burnout on performance through job satisfaction can vary (Davis et al., 2018).  Effect of Work-Life Balance and Burnout on Performance with Job Satisfaction as an Intervening Variable Finally, the research confirms that both Work-Life Balance and burnout impact job performance with job satisfaction as an intervening variable. The balance between work and personal life, along with managing burnout, affects job performance through its influence on job satisfaction. This finding is supported by Morris and Thompson (2021), who found that job satisfaction plays a significant role in mediating the effects of Work-Life Balance and burnout on performance (Morris & Thompson, 2021). This is also consistent with Carter and Evans (2022), who highlighted the importance of job satisfaction in understanding the relationships between work-life balance, burnout, and performance (Carter & Evans, 2022). These findings collectively underscore the critical role of Work-Life Balance and burnout in shaping job satisfaction and performance, reinforcing the need for strategies that address both aspects to enhance nurse performance and well-being at Pertala Burmi Urmurm Hospital.  6. Conclusions  Based on the data management and statistical analysis, this study concludes that Work-Life Balance and burnout significantly affect various aspects of job performance among nurses at Pertala Burmi Urmurm Hospital. Specifically, Work-Life Balance positively influences both the productivity and performance of nurses, suggesting that a well-maintained balance between work and personal life contributes to better job outcomes. Conversely, workaholism and burnout have detrimental effects on performance, indicating that excessive work demands and emotional exhaustion negatively impact nurses' job efficiency and overall work quality. These findings align with existing literature, highlighting the importance of addressing both work-life balance and burnout to improve job performance and satisfaction.  
   Insan Kamil Wahyudi, Deswarta  153   Future research should explore the mechanisms through which Work-Life Balance and burnout impact performance more deeply. Longitudinal studies could provide insights into how these relationships evolve over time and offer more comprehensive data on the long-term effects of work-life balance initiatives and burnout management. Additionally, investigating other potential moderating or mediating variables, such as organizational support or individual coping strategies, could further elucidate the complex interactions between work-life balance, burnout, and job performance. Research focusing on different healthcare settings or diverse professional groups could also enhance the generalizability of these findings and contribute to developing targeted interventions to improve work environments and employee well-being.
