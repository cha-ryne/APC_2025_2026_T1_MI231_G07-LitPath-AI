    "abstract": "Chili pepper is an economically important crop in the Philippines, but its production are limited by environmental constraints due to its vulnerability to extreme weather conditions, particularly with intense rain resulting to waterlogging. With this, an intervention using plant growth regulators, specifically, brassinolide (BL), ethephon (ETP), and paclobutrazol (PBZ) was attempted in this experiment. The research consisted of three parts: the preliminary screening, the plant growth regulator treatment, and the community survey. The preliminary screening showed that the hybrid Pinatubo variety posed some level of tolerance to prolonged periods of waterlogging as compared to the Taiwan variety, which started from two (2) weeks; four (4) weeks; to six (6) weeks; and a 7 days recovery period in between. Thus, the Pinatubo variety was used for the plant growth regulator treatment. With the application of different PGRs, the morphological traits observed indicate that chili pepper plants may have elicited a defense mechanism against waterlogging stress. This is evident with the number of parameters that showed significant differences including plant height, leaf weight, root weight, fruit length and average weight of fruits per plant. Among these parameters, the BL treatment and the ETP treated pepper plants would have a value that is close to that of the control. Most of these parameters significantly differs with waterlogged only plants, such as the root length and number of leaves and flowers. While there may be some inconsistencies to fully differentiate the treatments, the waterlogged only plants appeared to be heavily affected by waterlogging condition, as compared to the control and other PGR treatments. As for the community survey, the perception of farmers from upland and lowland area in the province of Cavite was assessed, showing that while the occurrence of flooding may not be as frequent as the occurrence of drought, many farmers are still worried about the intense and heavy rain which can greatly impact their production and yield, especially for vulnerable crops.",

    "abstract": "This study was conducted to review the medicinal and other non-fiber economic uses of M. textilis, and analyze the available genomes and transcriptomes of M. textilis and M. balbisiana in silico to identify genes associated with their production of secondary metabolites. Results showed that the abaca plant is traditionally utilized to address medical conditions such as wound, relapse, fatigue, muscle pain, and gastrointestinal problems. It also exhibits the potential to be used in other non-fiber industries such as in cosmetics, colorant, food, and fuel and energy industries. In addition, phytochemicals including phenolic compounds, phytosterols, phenylphenalenone type compounds, and cyanogenic glycosides were reported in abaca and could support its efficacy as a traditional medicinal plant and its applications for other economic purposes. Using the available genomic and transcriptomic data for M. textilis and M. balbisiana, putative genes which are participatory in the biosynthesis of secondary metabolites including terpenes, phenylpropanoids, and flavonoids were identified. The presence of putative biosynthetic gene clusters in the genomes of these two Musa plants, which are likely involved in the synthesis of saccharides, polyketides, lignans, and terpenes, was also reported, Further, the STRING database analysis considering the commonly upregulated genes in the abaca pseudostem resulted in a protein-protein interaction network that has 181 protein nodes and 2147 edges showing the interactions among the proteins involved in the biosynthesis of terpenes, phenylpropanoids, flavonoids, glucan, and cytoskeleton. This study therefore presents the wide range of economic uses of abaca which are beyond its applications in the fiber industry, and the potential of its underexplored secondary metabolites for medical, industrial, and agricultural applications.",

Based on farm household surveys of 460 upland farmers, focus group discussion with 93 participants, site surveys and direct observations, key informant interviews, and secondary data gathering, the study revealed that upland smallholder farmers and farming communities that have continuously adopted a wide- range of conservation farming practices led to the formation of multifunctional agroforestry systems with a high potential for farm tourism. Adoption decisions of farm households were modeled using a multivariate probit technique. Analysis revealed that livestock, farm size and distance, tenure, education, fertilizer availability, connections, kinship, groups and traders, extension services, soil fertility, and pests and diseases all influenced farmer investment in agroforestry systems. Policies and government services that aim to enhance the skill of farmers and extension agents and the provision of subsidies, such as agricultural inputs, could improve the adoption of agroforestry systems. The study developed a model for agroforestry adoption as a gateway to farm tourism and sustainable upland farming communities in the Philippines.",

    "abstract": "The presence of Cr and Ni in agricultural land particularly in rice paddies as affected by mining activities represents a major risk to the environment and human health. Thus, remediation techniques such as the application of soil amendments and vetiver as phytoremediator are very important to remove or minimize the concentration of these heavy metals. The study was conducted to evaluate various remediation techniques to reduce the absorption and translocation of Cr and Ni in lowland rice in Barangay Lomboy, Santa Cruz Zambales and at the same time increase rice productivity in the area. The experimental set-up was conducted in two (2) cropping seasons, phytoremediation using vetiver and application of different soil amendments to NSIC Rc 160 rice seed variety at a rate of 10t ha⁻¹ combined with inorganic fertilizer were used. Each plot has a dimension of 4m x 5m and spaced at 0.50 m from each other. All agronomic, soil and tissue parameters were laid out in Randomized Complete Block Design with four replications except for the vetiver set-ups. The use of vetiver significantly reduced the amount of total Cr by 4.3%, available Cr by 8.53%, total Ni by 9.86% and available Ni by 14.26% in the soil. When grown for 3 months, the roots were able to accumulate 3.83 kg Cr ha⁻¹ and 3.66 kg Ni ha⁻¹ with only 0.03 kg Cr ha⁻¹ and 0.07 kg Ni ha⁻¹ in shoots. After 8 months, the amount of Cr accumulated in the roots and shoots increased to 6.36 and 0.04 kg Cr ha⁻¹ respectively. For Ni, it only increased to 4.12 and 3.66 kg Ni ha⁻¹ . Measured in terms of bioaccumulation factor (BAF), vetiver had a BAF of 0.97 for Cr and 1.07 for Ni after 3 months of growth and 1.48 for Cr and 1.38 for Ni after 8 months, indicating higher concentration of Cr and Ni in the plant than in the soil. The translocation factors at both 3 and 8 months were below 0.2 mg kg⁻¹ which is the prescribed limit given by the Codex Standard and European Union, suggesting that vetiver accumulates Cr and Ni in the roots and very small amount of Cr and Ni are translocated to the shoots, making the plant safe for forage purposes. Aside from the beneficial effects in mitigating soil ‘pollutants, vetiver also improved soil pH and percent organic matter. The Cr and Ni content in rice grains after planted the area with 3 months vetiver, were efficiently reduced to below detection limits. Also, growing vetiver before rice reduced grain yield since vetiver is also a good accumulator of nutrients. The use of vermicast, carbonized rice hull, bagasse ash and zeolite combined with inorganic fertilizer increased grain yield and at the same time reduced the uptake of Cr and Ni in grains. Total and available Cr and Ni in the soil were markedly reduced as compared to the control. Higher yield was obtained with the addition of vermicast. Zeolite was the most effective soil amendment in mitigating total and available Cr, available Ni while carbonized rice hull for total Ni in the soil. Highest return on investment was realized with the application of bagasse ash due to its cheaper/free cost while lowest ROI was observed with zeolite due to its relatively higher cost.",

    "abstract": "A two-factor strip plot field experiment was conducted from March to August 2017 and 2018 to screen response of cultivated soybean varieties to waterlogging at two developmental stages, and distinguish the morphological traits of tolerant/susceptible cultivars, and identify traits that can be used as selection criteria for flooding tolerance. Response of cultivars to the timing of the stress at fourteen days waterlogged duration was significant on seed yield per se and on the seed yield governing components. Based on seed yield damage index, PSB Sy1 is the most tolerant genotype followed by the landrace 'Manchuria'; PSB Sy6 followed by PSB Sy3 were determined as the most susceptible genotypes under waterlogged condition. The effect on soybean seed yield of the two waterlogging stress timings (viz. 30 days after planting (DAP) and beggining bloom (R1) stage) were equal in statistical rank. Forthwith, it is suggested that the number of pods plant⁻¹ coupled with high percentage of seed-filled pods and the weight of seeds (plant⁻¹) are the crucial seed yield components. Flooding stress caused damage on root length and shoot dry matter partitioning on susceptible genotypes, whereas the tolerant PSB Sy1 (across waterlogging treatments) was able to increase its root length, and leaf and stem partitioned dry matter. It appears that the tolerance mechanisms of soybean to waterlogging acts on the different seed yield components. Result suggests that it is viable and crucial to test soybean cultivars or varieties for waterlogging tolerance based on seed yield response and its relevant component traits.",

The two plantations studied were the old rubber plantation inside the Molawin-Dapalit subwatershed and the young stand located in MMFR Buffer Zone near the boundaries of PCC and DTRI. The methodologies to attain the objective are: 1) field reconnaissance survey, plot establishment and data collection; 2) assessment and comparison of the two sites in terms of their soil fertility, coverage of vegetative mats, amount of litter and above and below ground carbon stock of vegetation, and soil organic carbon at 50 cm depth; and 3) literature review. In terms of supporting service through soil fertility, the old stand was found to be fertile in terms of the available amount of phosphorus, sufficient amount of exchangeable potassium and amount of nitrogen than the young stand. In terms of the amount of soil organic matter in the surface soil (0-20cm), the young stand had significant higher amount at 5.84% than 4.46% in the old stand while in the sub-soil the values are lower and were not significantly different between the two sites. The soil reaction in the surface soil was also significantly higher in the young stand at pH 5.95 than in the old stand at pH 5.10 and their sub-surface soil pH were not significantly different In terms of regulatory services through erosion regulation, the two stand were not significantly different in this function, although vegetation mats composition were very different between the young and the old stand. Another regulatory service was climate regulation through carbon storage and it was found out that the total estimated stored carbon of the old stand was 375.69 tons/ha significantly higher against the young stand at 131.62 tons/ha. The ecosystem services of the young and old stands differed primarily due to their age gap, species composition and management scheme.",

To determine the appropriate method for estimating the subclasses, this paper presents a comparative analysis of the ratio estimators and their corresponding standard errors computed using the Taylor Series Linearization and Random Group methods. It was theoretically shown that for a simple random sample, TSL performs better than RG in terms of bias and precision, hence lower mean squared error. These properties are then verified using the LFS 2016 data where unemployment rate at the domain level are computed. Moreover, this comparison is extended to the subclass level where the validity of the variance formulas is expected to weaken due to smaller sample sizes.",

It assessed the dynamics of land-use change in the area, formulate models of the dynamics of landslide and flooding events in the area, simulated the models for landslide and flooding at different time-slices and at different climate scenarios combining the land-use change model results; generated multi- hazard maps to determine the areas within the watershed prone to natural hazards for the year 2050 and 2070; and recommend strategies for public responsiveness, disaster preparedness, and preventive disaster management to mitigate the impacts of geophysical and climate-induced hazards in the area. The resulting LULC classification has an accuracy of 87% and 80% and Kappa statistics of 0.83 and 0.73 for the year 2010 and 2020, respectively. Assessment of the landslide susceptibility model obtained an accuracy based on ROC of 0.80, while the area under the curve is 94% and the Kappa index is 0.58. The flood susceptibility model ROC-AUC of 98%, Accuracy of 0.95, and Kappa index of 0.89. This means that the model is consistent in predicting the probability of occurrence of natural hazards. GIS-based Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis (GIS-MCDA) and Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) provides powerful techniques for the analysis and prediction of floods and landslide hazards. Simulated natural hazards for different time periods (2020, 2050, and 2070) and climatic condition RCP 4.5 (medium case) and RCP 8.5 (worst case scenario) used a raster calculator to compute in hectare the areas prone to flooding and landslide. Integrated hazards maps were used to evaluate the condition of MMWFR. Results of integrated hazard in 2050 with the RCP 4.5 scenario show that areas with low susceptibility to hazards both in flooding and landslide totaled 7,709.98 ha, accounting for 60.26 % of the total area of MMWER. Almost 40% of the total area will fall in different combinations of moderate to very high susceptibility to landslide and flooding across the four municipalities covering MMWFR. In the year 2050 and with RCP 8.5, around 52.56 % of the total area has low susceptibility to flooding and landslide while 47.44 % of the total area is under moderate to very high susceptibility. For the 2070 results of integrated hazards with RCP 4.5, almost half of the area or 49.59% will be exposed to moderate, high, and very high susceptibility classes while 50.41% falls under low landslide and low flooding. However, for the year 2070 and with RCP 8.5 scenario, 76.68% of the area will experience different combinations of moderate to very high susceptibility to flooding and landslide since only 23.32% will fall under low landslide and low flooding.",

This study aimed to characterize the rates of leaf appearance and elongation of all leaves of the main tillers of contrasting rice plants, and to determine the relationship that exist between the two rates. Eleven contrasting rice genotypes were grown in 13-L pots under flooded conditions in a greenhouse at the International Rice Research Institute in June and September 2013. In contrast with previous reports of bilinear kinetics of leaf appearance, the study revealed trilinear kinetics in most varieties across sowing dates because the first four leaves appeared faster, rendering two inflection points. Leaf elongation rate (LER) of all genotypes increased linearly with leaf rank until it reached leaves 9 to 14 then it gradually decreased. Thus, the leaf with maximum LER was the last leaf to appear before the rate of leaf appearance was reduced. A transition period between the two linear parts of the leaf appearance curve, covering 3 -4 leaves, was found in genotypes with trilinear kinetics. The precise methodology employed led to the discovery of transition period across genotypes and sowing dates, which was not captured in previous studies. This finding will avoid overestimation in the simulation of leaf area and will improve database for breeding and crop improvement. Further research on the cellular level is needed to determine the activity of meristem cell division and elongation.",

The genetic distance values revealed narrow genetic diversity of inbred lines within the population. Meanwhile, heterotic groups were established using different schemes, namely F₁ yield per se, heterosis, heterotic grouping based on GCA of multiple traits (HGCAMT), specific combining ability (SCA), and heterotic group’s specific and general combing ability (HSGCA). Among the different schemes, classification of inbred lines based on F₁ yield per se and heterosis were the most efficient at 66.67% with two heterotic groups followed by the groupings based on SCA and HSGCA at 44.44%, and HGCAMT at 34.29%. Hence, two-heterotic-group model is the most efficient classification of the evaluated inbred lines. Additionally, the groupings based on agronomic and on molecular data generated a breeding efficiency of 58.82% and 32.50%, respectively. Inconsistencies between the different grouping methods assessed based on genetic distance measures and on agronomic performance can be attributed to the narrow genetic diversity of the sample population. It is recommended that future work deal with a more diverse population to have a better overview of the heterotic groupings within the germplasm. Nonetheless, there exists commercially valuable heterosis within the population despite fairly narrow genetic diversity of the germplasm.",

    "abstract": "This study aimed to set priorities for conservation among useful plants of the Alangan Mangyan of Mt. Ilong, Halcon Range, Mindoro Island, Philippines. Information on plant ecology of Mt. Ilong and traditional knowledge of the Alangan people were utilized for local conservation priority setting of species. The useful plants of the Alangan people were documented from interviews among 60 key informants and verified by the elderly key informants. This study recorded 199 local names of plants (wild and cultivated types) with varying uses. Patterns on plant use indicate that there were more cultivated than wild plant species for food, fodder, medicine, and firewood use categories, while more wild than cultivated species were recorded for construction and lumber use categories. The plants were verified in the field during a study of the vegetation structure and dynamics of tree species in Mt. Ilong, Halcon Range. Hierarchical cluster analysis in unweighted pair group arithmetic mean (UPGMA) algorithm (using Bray-Curtis similarity index) was performed to identify major plant communities in Mt. Ilong, namely; Zone I (agroforest), Lansium - Artocarpus - Swietenia - Ficus - Nephelium - Mangifera zone; Zone II (forest zone), Cyathea - Astronia - Syzygium - Garcinia - Ficus - Psydrax - Diplodiscus zone; and Zone III (forest zone), Agathis - Suli - Alitugba - Ardisia zone. Furthermore, ordination using canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) was performed to analyze the relationship between the tree species and selected environmental variables. Temperature and elevation were the greatest influencing environmental factors that affected the species distribution in Mt. Ilong. An evaluation index for species level was devised to set priorities for conservation. The conservation priority index is a point-scoring procedure, composed of seven criteria encompassing ecological, socio-cultural significance, and present threat assessment which are important considerations when setting conservation priorities for conservation. Seventy-two wild plant species identified from field survey and vegetation analysis were evaluated using the devised index. From this evaluation, 17 species were identified as species of medium priority for conservation. Furthermore, a nonlinear principal component analysis was also done to identify which among the criteria have influenced in conservation priority setting. The results of this study can be useful in conservation management in the local level, as the index promotes the involvement of the local people in conservation. Moreover, the methodology used in setting conservation priorities of plants species can be simulated to other localities in the Philippines.",

    "abstract": "Manamoc Island was among the small islands in the Philippines experiencing coastal retreat. With the threats of hydrometeorological hazards, coastal retreat could get worse. It is therefore, imperative to enhance the resilience of Manamoc Island to hydrometeorological hazards through enhancing coping mechanisms. To do so, this study sought the following: 1) describe the coastal dynamics around Manamoc Island; 2) evaluate the suitability and possibility of mangroves as mitigating measures for coastal retreat; and 3) enhance the community resiliency to withstand hydrometeorological hazards. In describing the coastal dynamics of Manamoc Island, the following were done: time-series analysis of shoreline change, longshore drift experiment, beach profiling and key informant interview (KII). Results have shown an average of 38 - 64.5m coastal retreat from 1989 — 2016. Apparently, it was due to the compounding effect of both natural factors such as monsoons, typhoons, and storm surge and anthropogenic factors such as livelihood activities, physical development (inftastructures), lack of policy addressing coastal retreat, and weak enforcement of environmental laws. Mangrove was one of the viable mitigating measures to apprehend the negative impacts of physical or natural factors triggering coastal retreat hence this study assessed the distribution, physiognomy and the factors affecting the distribution of mangroves in the island through vegetation sampling using plot method. Results have shown that among the 11 species found in Manamoc Island, Rhizophora mucronata was the dominant species. Rhizophora species are good land stabilizers because of their complex root system adaptation. Moreover, this genus is resilient to typhoons. Cluster analysis of mangroves resulted to 5 clusters: Cluster I — Avicennia marina (Forsk.) Vierh.; Cluster II — Bruguiera sexangula (Lour.) Poi; Cluster II] — Rhizophora apiculata Blume and Rhizophora mucronata Lam. Cluster TV — R. mucronata Lam, and Cluster V — Sonneratia alba J. Smith. Clustering followed the zonation of mangroves: landward, middleward, and seaward. The distribution of mangrove vegetation was greatly influenced by soil pH, soil texture and Nitrogen as evidenced by the Canonical Correspondence Analysis (CCA). Systems analysis of Manamoc Island in the context of coastal retreat recommended enhancing coping mechanisms to hydrometeorological hazards through: establishment of mangrove corridors; reforestation and planting of local beach forest species along the coastline; polishing of local ordinances and empowering local enforcers; and education at all levels to let the community understand that their activities negatively affected the natural barriers against hydrometeorological hazards.",

    "abstract": "The adventitious roots (ARs) of vanilla (Vanilla planifolia Jacks. ex Andrews) are primarily responsible for the firm anchorage and vertical growth and development of this important spice. The effects of different types of supporting structures and applications of plant growth regulators (PGRs) on the growth and attachment properties of ARs were investigated. The ARs attached to natural support posts (Gliricidia sepium [Jacq.] Steud. and Sphaerobambos philippinensis [Gamble] S.Dransf.) appeared to be flattened due to the significant increase in root width. In contrast, slender ARs attached to artificial support posts (GI wire [control treatment], PVC pipes, concrete and styrofoam) were observed. The appearance of long and slender ARs attached to artificial posts and flattened ARs attached to natural support posts were probably adaptive root traits to increase water retention and improve phosphorus (P) and nitrogen (N) acquisitions. The maximum increment growth in length and width (2.1 mm and 0.25 mm d⁻¹, respectively) of the ARs attached to G. sepium was achieved after 4 d. The attachment strength, the force that maintains the permanent attachment of ARs to the support post, was greatest when ARs were attached to G. sepium (935.44 ± 514.60 mN) while the least force was exerted when ARs were attached to S. Philippinensis (179.70 ± 148.72 mN). The texture of the support post was observed to primarily influence the attachment strengths of ARs. The type of materials used as substrates was shown to contribute mainly to the growth and attachment of ARs than the applications of PGRs. No variations were observed on the growth of ARs attached to cork substrate treated with indole-3-butyric acid (IBA) and abscisic acid (ABA), but the application of 2,3,5-triiodobenzoic acid (TIBA) significantly shortened the ARs. On the other hand, IBA-treated ARs with glass substrate were noticeably reduced in size. The number of permanently attached roots was not significant in PGR-treated roots with cork substrate; however, ABA and TIBA applications induced attachment while IBA induced detachment of ARs with glass as substrate. The attachment strategy of vanilla ARs was characterized into three stages according to the size and the extent of adhesion, namely (1) initial contact; (2) weak to strong attachment and; (3) strong and permanent attachment. The root tip was identified to send signal to produce root hairs on the ventral side of the root facing the substrate which interacted with the surface of the substrate that brought the adhesion. Profuse unicellular elongated root hairs in the velamen were only observed on ARs that were attached to solid support posts.",

    "abstract": "Stichopus cf. horrens is a high value sea cucumber species. It is known to be nocturnal, negatively phototactic and positively thigmotactic based on short term laboratory studies. This thesis examined the influence of light on the behaviour and growth of post-settled juveniles (4-10 mm; 0 g; 62 days after fertilization) and 6-month old juveniles (4.27 g to 19.41 g) for 30 days. Post-settled juveniles were exposed to 3 photoperiods (24L, 24D, and 12L:12D cycle), with either the presence or absence of an artificial seagrass unit as shelter, while 6 month-old juveniles were subjected to different light treatments (covered, exposed, half-covered) under a natural light-dark cycle in aquaria with sediment. Absolute growth rate (AGR) and survival were calculated. Younger juveniles fed predominantly during the day early in the experiment (days 1 and 11), and then shifted to nighttime feeding later on (days 19 and 29). The earliest to exhibit the shift were the juveniles exposed to light (24L and 12L:12D), while the last were those in constant dark (24D). The shift in the diel feeding pattern occurred even in the absence of a light and dark cycle, which indicates that nocturnal feeding is developmentally determined or it develops as the juveniles grow older. This shift is an indication of endogenous and developmentally determined nocturnal feeding. Although post-settled juveniles fed equally on the jar’s surface and the shelters, higher growth was observed in treatments with shelters. The shelters could have provided additional substratum for the biofilm to grow and also minimized interaction among conspecifics. Further, the younger juveniles in continuous dark treatments with shelter had the highest growth (0.46 cm/day + 0.04 SD) and survival (90%). Older juveniles in the half-exposed treatment hid at the comers of the shaded portion of the aquaria, usually with a conspecific, suggesting negative phototaxis and positive thigmotaxis. Positive thigmotaxis was also observed in the covered and exposed treatments. Contrasting results were obtained for juvenile growth in the covered and exposed treatments. Juveniles in the covered treatment had low growth rates (-0.07 + 0.03 g/day) but 100% survival, while juveniles in the exposed treatment had high growth (13.44 mg/g + 4.57 SD) but low survival (50%). The growth differences might be due to variations in the abundance of food in the sediments between the two treatments. The older juveniles were predominantly feeding at night throughout the experiment, although some were still seen feeding during the day.",

Under laboratory conditions, the eggs hatched in 1.77 and 1.87 days, respectively for the males and females. Developmental period was shorter in males (36.16 ± 15.57) compared to females (38.30 ± 16.23). The four larval instars, from first to 4ᵗʰ, respectively, lasted for 2.32 ± 0.9 and 2.35 ± 0.95 days, 2.90 ± 1.98 and 2.96 ± 1.25 days, 6.15 ± 2.94 and 6.98 ± 3.24 days, and 17.5 ± 12.6 and 19.21 ± 13.59 days for the males and females, respectively. Males live shorter (12.9 ± 10.44) than females (18.38 ± 14.76). Number of preys offered to 7x. splendens larvae positively correlated to duration of the stages for both males and females. Higher juvenile mortality and shorter adult longevity were observed at higher prey densities. Resulting adults of larvae fed with 10 to 20 preys daily, lived longest. Organic matter in the breeding container shortened larval development by half. Average fecundity was 19.80 eggs, with 96.60% viability over a reproductive period of 14.80 days, about 15.30 days after mating. Oviposition occurred either in flight or on water surface. Tx. splendens occurred in the wild throughout the monitoring period (August 2013 - July 2014). It was most abundant in September. Eggs peaked in April 2014. Larvae were collected from various water containers. Tx. splendens larva preys on larvae of Aedes aegypti (Linnaeus), Ae. albopictus Skuse, Culex quinquefasciatus Say, Cx. pipiens Linnaeus, Ochleratus sp. (Skuse), Tipula sp. Linnaeus, and ephydrid larvae. Adults were observed to feed on Pachystachis lutea Nees, Ixora sp., and Justicia sp. Tx. splendens possess a type II functional response. Relative voracity of 7x. splendens was tested in the laboratory. One larva can consume a total of 328.75 Ae. aegypti and 316.97 Ae. albopictus larvae. Fourth instar was the most voracious, consuming 59.23 - 68.08% and 58.6 - 69.9% Ae. aegypti and Ae. albopictus, respectively. Tx. splendens preferred Ae. aegypti over Ae. albopictus and Cx. quinquefasciatus. Tx. splendens devours prey in proportion to its own body size and instar. Larval cannibalism was observed in Tx. splendens especially at lower prey densities.",

At 1 DAA, FertiGroe®N significantly increased UA in LCL but adversely affected UA in SSL. HormoGroe® significantly enhanced UA in SSL at 35 DAA but significantly decreased UA in SSL at 75 DAA. Soil MCB was significantly decreased by nCuO in LCL and by nZnO in SSL only at 7 DAA. FertiGroe®N had no adverse on MCB but HormoGroe® decreased significantly the MCB at 1 and 75 DAA in SSL. Regardless of amendment, LCL had higher DHA and UA but lower MCB than SSL. The nanomaterials and the non-nanomaterials had similar effects on the parameters measured which were influenced by the soil type.

    "abstract": "Excelsa coffee (Coffea excelsa A.Chev.) species is known to be hard-to-root when propagated through stem cuttings. This study sought to initiate rooting in Excelsa coffee through the use of a variety of auxin synergists and energy accumulation strategies for the stem cuttings. Furthermore, the morpho-anatomical differences between Excelsa and Robusta coffee stem cuttings were examined to identify any physical hindrances to rooting. The coffee stem cuttings from watersprouts were stimulated to root in three propagation experiments lasting up to 4-7 months. The single-node orthotropic and three- node plagiotropic Excelsa coffee stem cuttings were treated with auxin combined with different phenolic compounds previously identified as auxin oxidase inhibitors. When the Excelsa coffee stem cuttings were propagated under mist, only the application of trans- ferulic acid promoted rooting. The application of 250 μM trans-ferulic acid plus auxin (500 ppm indole butyric acid + 100 ppm α-napthalene acetic acid) promoted rooting in single- node orthotropic stem cuttings after 7 months of rooting observation and in single-node orthotropic cuttings with incisions made in the rooting zone after 6 months of observation. In three-node plagiotropic stem cuttings, high survival was evident. Ferulic acid promoted survival and adventitious rooting possibly due to its antimicrobial effect. Morpho-anatomical examinations revealed that Excelsa has thicker stem structures as compared to Robusta except for vascular cambium which is thicker in freshly-harvested Robusta. However, the most probable anatomical difference why Excelsa is harder to root when compared to Robusta coffee possibly due to its compact and clustered nearly- continuous layer of sclerenchymatic band as opposed to the discontinuous layer in Robusta or delayed development of root initials. Cuts or incisions in the rooting zone of the stem cutting of Excelsa coffee aimed at breaking the layer of sclerenchymatic band promoted more roots. Formation of adventitious roots could be associated with dedifferentiation of the parenchyma cells and is believed to originate in the secondary xylem-vascular cambium region.",

The results of the characterization tests verified the successful synthesis of nano-sized ZnO (45 nm via SEM-EDX Spectroscopy) with low degree of aggregation and high chemical purity (59% Zn via EDS; 90.39% ZnO via XRF Spectroscopy). FT-IR spectroscopy confirmed the presence of the Zn and O bonds. The synthesized nano ZnO (SNZ) was therefore an ideal source of Zn foliar fertilizer for tomato. The performance of SNZ as foliar fertilizer was tested on pot-grown tomato (var ‘Marimax’), and compared with bulk-size ZnO (BZ), commercial nano ZnO (CNZ), and granular Zinc sulfate (ZS). Boric acid was incorporated to a separate set of the Zn foliar treatments in order to determine the synergistic effects of Zn and B on the yield and postharvest quality of tomato. The SNZ+B treatment resulted in a positive response in terms of plant height, number of clusters per plant, SPAD units, number of leaves, flowers, and fruits per plant, percent fruit set, Zn and B uptake, dry matter yield and marketable yield. Foliar application of SNZ+B also led to significant improvements in fruit quality, including higher TSS, %TA, and Vitamin C content.",

    "abstract": "Family history plays an important role in cancer risk assessment and management as it reflects the contribution of inherited genes, shared lifestyle and environmental factors in the development of disease in the family. An individual’s understanding of family history influences perceptions of cancer risks and control, which consequently affect adoption of health behaviours and screening practices. However, discrepancies may exist between the ways lay people and health professionals perceive family history, hindering effective use of family history in cancer risk communication and promotion of health behaviours. This study aimed to address this gap and explore lay constructs of family history of cancer in relation to perceptions of disease causation and inheritance of genes, perceived risk, and risk management among Filipino first-degree relatives (FDRs) of cancer patients. Employing a qualitative descriptive research design, the investigators also identified variations in meanings of family history between siblings and children of affected relatives, and between Filipinos with first-degree relatives diagnosed with early onset cancer from those with relatives who developed cancer at typical ages. A purposive sample of seventeen (17) individuals, who are siblings or offspring of patients diagnosed with colorectal cancer at the University of the Philippines-Philippine General Hospital were interviewed. Qualitative content analysis (QCA) and continuous comparative analysis (CCA) were employed to identify and compare themes and patterns in the interviews. The findings of the study confirm the constructs of the Model of Familial Risk Perception. Perceived familial and personal risks are significantly influenced by the individual’s understanding of their family history of disease, disease inheritance, and perceived control. One new finding is the presence of two opposite definitions of “family history” among Filipino first-degree relatives, which affect how they recognize and classify their familial risk of developing the disease. These variations in meanings and understanding of family history have been found to influence participants’ understanding of their familial risks and personal sense of vulnerability. The study highlights potential differences between the way Filipino FDRs and clinicians determine and understand familial risk of cancer, and points out the need for exploration of these discrepancies for a more effective risk communication.",

The gel consistency of the samples ranged from 28 to 59 mm (hard to medium). On the other hand, the gelatinization temperature for Mabango 3 was low (<70°C) and intermediate (70°- 74°C) for Tubigan 18, Lian, and Camotes. Cooking water, cooking time, and height increase were directly proportional to the amount of com. The water absorption index (WAI) and water solubility index (WSJ) increased with greater amounts of com. Sensory evaluation results revealed that Lian-Camotes (90:10, 80:20,70:30), Tubigan 18-Camotes (90:10, 80:20,70:30), and Mabango 3-Camotes (90:10, 80:20,70:30) were the top nine most acceptable mixtures. Proximate compositions between raw and cooked samples were not significantly different from each other. Minerals, essential amino acids, phytochemicals, and antioxidant capacity significantly decreased after cooking. Starch and amylose significantly increased after cooking. On the other hand, amylopectin decreased after cooking. Correlation analysis also found that amylopectin has a strong positive correlation with Estimated Glycemic Index (EGI). Based on CODEX Alimentarius, EAR (Estimated Average Requirements), and RENI (Recommended Energy and Nutrient Intakes), rice and pigmented com grits mix is a good source of protein, zinc, phosphorus, and energy and thus, can contribute to food and nutrition security.",

The RILs were selected and genotyped using Genotyping by Sequencing (GBS) technology. The genotyped data was used to correlate with the phenotype data of the 142 F₁₄DT-RILs evaluated at seedling stage under phosphorus deficient condition. Nine-hundred ninety two (992) markers were used to generate the genetic linkage map using inclusive composite interval mapping (ICIM) software version 4.1. The generated linkage map showed a total length of 3061.76 cM with an average interval size of 3.0864 cM. Permutation analysis of the data was done obtaining an LOD threshold of 3.4068. Twenty eight QTLs were identified in chromosome 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10, and 12 explaining 5.6068 to 20.8062% of the phenotypic variance.

Potentially good QTLs showing significant LOD and phenotypic variance were selected because of their position that is associated with other genes and markers. Fine-mapping of these QTLs - qRL5, qRL9 and qTSA9 - is recommended for further identification of closely linked markers for marker-assisted breeding purposes. The three QTLs are potentially good because their position is associated with genes that could be underlying in their position.",

    "abstract": "This study was designed to investigate a possible explanation of the flight and aggregation behavior of the rice black bug (RBB), Scotinophara coarctata by linking these behaviors to the reproduction of the bug and rice phenology. Greenhouse and field studies were conducted to determine if oviposition of RBB is confined to certain phenological stage of rice and if this oviposition preference is reflected in the population dynamics of rice black bug over two cropping seasons. Behavioral experiments showed that RBB discriminated against the seedling stage as oviposition site. The significantly higher number of eggmasses laid on the booting and soft dough stages of rice, as well as the number of visits and the length of time RBB stayed on these stages compared to other stages indicate a preference to these phenological stage. It was evident from the age structure, population dynamics and monitoring of the reproductive status of RBB over two croppings that individuals arriving in the rice field were mostly immature and unmated, and that only one reproductive cycle was completed in a cropping season. Based on the patterns observed in the field and greenhouse experimentation, reproductive cycles and oviposition behavior of RBB are apparently influenced by the phenology of rice. Because of this specific requirement in oviposition, a wide scale absence of appropriate growth stage of rice and other possible host plants in an area for an extended period of time could be a driving factor that leads to flight to seek favorable habitat involving a large number of individuals. It is recommended that a landscape scale of analysis should be done to further test the above hypothesis. A mark-recapture technique needs to be conducted to fully document movement and flight of RBB.",

This study aimed to determine the RGP of three native species namely, Bignai (Antidesma bunius), Kamagong (Diospyros blancoi) and Molave (Vitex parviflora), and find its correlation with other morphological parameters. Different taproot pruning lengths (I-cm pruning, 2-cm pruning and no root pruning) were also applied as treatments. In general, taproot pruning had no significant effects on the seedling morphological attributes for all species. But, excluding Molave, the two other species had mostly responded well to root pruning and can be recommended as treatment to induce root growth development. RGP had generally complemented the results from the other parameters, illustrating how root development was associated with the morphological growth of the species. The study shows how RGP can be relied on for testing seedling health and status.",

    "abstract": "Peatlands are freshwater wetlands characterized by the deep accumulation of partly decomposed organic materials called “peat” and are an important terrestrial carbon pool. However, human interventions such as land use changes and unsustainable land management have adversely affected peatland ecosystems. One negative impact of these activities is that peatlands become sources of CO₂ emissions. In the Philippines, very little attention is given to peatland GHG emissions and how these contribute to global warming. This study is a first attempt to measure GHG emissions of a peatland in the country. The main objective of the study was to determine the degree of emissions of peat-derived greenhouse gases (GHGs) such as carbon dioxide (CO₂), methane (CH₄) and nitrous oxide (N₂0) to the atmosphere across vegetation cover types. Taking into consideration selected soil physico-chemical parameters and other environmental variables, the extent of soil CO₂, CH₄ and N₂O fluxes across land uses in Bambanin peatland, Victoria, Oriental Mindoro was investigated during wet and dry seasons. Results revealed that the highest average gross CO₂ flux of 232.47 Mg ha⁻¹y⁻¹ was released at the cultivated area followed by the forestland (171.02 Mg ha⁻¹y⁻¹) and grassland (102.88 Mg ha⁻¹y⁻¹) owing to lowered water table level and decomposition of soil organic matter. The low water table greatly influenced the CH₄ emissions across sites especially in the dry season. Negative emissions were displayed by the forested (0.002 Mg ha⁻¹y⁻¹ and cultivated (-0.003 Mg ha-1y-1) sites while grassland emitted 0.013 Mg ha⁻¹y⁻¹. The highest gross N₂0 emission of 0.045 Mg ha⁻¹y⁻¹, on the other hand, was observed during the dry season at the grassland site as a result of burning where a 93% increase from wet season’s emission was recorded. In contrast, both forested and cultivated sites demonstrated a decline in the N₂O emissions of 58% and 86%, respectively, from wet to dry season. Future projections by 2050 indicated that forest cover in the peatland will decrease by 15% while cropland, grassland, built-up and perennial crop areas will be increased by 11%, 22%, 74 % and 75%, respectively. If forest conversions and expansion of croplands and built-up areas will prevail in the succeeding years, higher emissions of these potent greenhouse gases to the atmosphere are very likely to happen. In terms of the concept and existence of a peatland in Bambanin, respondents tended to have a relatively high level of awareness. However, deeper understanding on the importance of peatland and the impacts of anthropogenic activities on the overall state/condition of the Bambanin peatland was lacking. Results of this study could be used in formulating mitigation policies particularly on the land use management that will address issues on peatland hydrology, agricultural activities and human encroachment to the protected area, The participation of the community in the decision- making process and implementation of local policies will also help in the sustainable peatland management.",

The primary aim of this study is to identify the determinant factors influencing the cooperative behavior of Barangay Bucal artisanal fishers, measured as consistent compliance to the formal choice rules, within the coastal fishery of Calamba City. In this study, formal choice rules refer to the enacted prescriptions of actions the fishers must, must not, or may take in the city’s coastal fishery. A questionaire survey was conducted last August 2015 using items previously proposed by Agrawal as recurrent factors associated with cooperative behavior in CPRs. The mode of the fishers’ compliance to the formal choice rules was also evaluated in the survey. Based on the skewness of their Compliance Index (CD), it was discovered that the consistent compliance to the formal choice rules among the artisanal fishers is moderate despite the existence of an alternative set of informal choice rules. Using phi, the fishers' level of wealth, age, educational attainment, mode of utilizing Laguna de Bay catfish, and membership status in the local fishermen’s association were found to be strongly associated with the consistency of their compliance to the formal choice rules. Specifically, through simple logistic regression it was revealed that the odds for consistent compliance is higher if a fisher a) has medium to high number of household fixtures, b) is more than 50 years old in age, c) has finished highschool, d) markets his Laguna de Bay catfish catch, and e) is a member of the organisation Barangay Bucal Fisheries and Aquatic Resources Management Council/Sagisag ng Mangingisda ng Barangay Bucal (BFARMC/SAMBBU). As such, these results show that increasing cooperation among the artisanal fishers in using the formal choice rules, which can potentially improve the conservation of the Calamba City-coastal fishery, is possible. Specifically, this can happen a) if the fishers are not experiencing survival constraints; b) if they have the necessary set of cognitive skills, interest, and knowledge of the political and ecological issues surrounding the management of the coastal fishery; and, c) if they have developed strong moral norms in favour of following the formal choice rules.",

    "abstract": "The technology transfer data of the Metals Industry Research and Development Center (MIRDC) covering the period from 2010-2014 showed that the Center's penetration rate of each sector of the metals and engineering (M&E) industries, namely tool and die, machining, forging, metalcasting, electroplating, heat treatment, and welding, was disproportioned. Metalcasting (49%) was the most penetrated sector while forging and electroplating (0%) were the sectors least penetrated. Total penetration rate for the whole M&E sector was low at 14.66%. In addition, the annual transfer rate for Grant-in-Aid (GIA) research and development (R&D) projects peaked at 40% in 2012- 2013, and dipped to its lowest at 0% in 2010-2011. The total technology transfer rate of GIA R&D (28%) was significantly smaller when compared to the transfer rate of Contract R&D (100%). This study aimed to contribute to the improvement of MIRDC's technology transfer performance through the: (1) development of a model that has the capability to predict the transferability of both Contract and GIA R&D outputs; and (2) identification of Critical Success Factors (CSF) for the transferability of these technologies. The Artificial Neural Network (ANN) technique was used to develop the predictive model because of its capability to quantify relationships between numerical and categorical variables. The model developed had a 93.75% prediction accuracy and 6 25% error rate. Using Binary Logistic Regression, it was identified that the CSF for the transferability of MIRDC-developed technologies were project duration, project value/cost, assistance to the welding sector, and product development R&D type. It is expected that the results of this study will aid key actors in making a more informed decision, particularly in technology transfer. Such that MIRDC’s Top Management may be able to formulate evidence-based policies related to R&D project planning and implementation. In addition, the results may be useful tools in guiding the MIRDC personnel towards better grasp of the R&D process and how the resulting technology can be made more effective and efficient for its purpose. Knowing and understanding the CSFs affecting the R&D technology transfer will enable MIRDC to effectively channel energy and resources to a more successful R&D project implementation. This will then redound to more benefits for the M&E industry.",

    "abstract": "This study aimed to determine the consumer acceptability and perceptions for brown rice among household heads in selected barangays in Caloocan City. The study employed a multimethod design utilizing quantitative and qualitative phases. The quantitative phase included a face-to-face interview (survey) on the basic sociodemographic and economic profiles of the household heads, self- administered knowledge assessment, and consumer acceptability test of the sensory attributes of brown rice. The qualitative phase included the conduct of focus group discussions (FGDs) discussing major themes that affect brown rice consumption among Filipinos. A total of 584, 104, and 176 respondents participated in the survey, consumer acceptability test, and FGDs, respectively. This research has been reviewed and approved by the UP Manila Research Ethics Board (UPMREB) - Ethics Review Panel via expedited review on 20 January 2017 with study protocol code: UPMREB 2016-403-01. The study revealed that the acceptability of brown rice was lower as compared to white rice, with significant mean differences in the consumer acceptability of the sensory attributes and the overall acceptability of brown rice (p<0.0001). Knowledge scores on the nutritional properties of brown rice and its attributes were low, with mean score of 53.7 percent. When the different covariates were tested for significance, it was revealed that price, color and appearance, and taste were all associated with the overall acceptability of brown rice among consumers. Specifically, the odds of acceptability of brown rice were 11 times higher if the consumer liked the color and appearance of rice (OR= 10.76, 95%CI: 2.50; 46.27), 20 times higher if the consumer liked the taste of rice (OR= 19.80; 95%CI: 2.99; 131.15), and 10 times higher when price was acceptable to the consumer (OR= 21.29; 95%CI: 3.87; 117.25). On the other hand, other factors associated with the acceptability of brown rice as based on the qualitative FGDs were awareness of the nutritional properties of brown rice, availability of brown rice in local wet markets, familiarity with brown rice, and the acceptability of brown rice to other family members, among others",

The public’s awareness of cholesterol at the community level is critical in potential prevention and preparedness. The aim of this paper was to assess the level of knowledge, attitude and practices (KAP) of adults (20-55 years) on cholesterol management and determine their risk to CVD. KAP scores were predefined as high, moderate, low and very low risk. Majority (N=263) of the population got good knowledge (85.2%), attitude (76.0%) and practice (71.9%) scores. The assessment showed that female respondents and those at their 20’s had higher overall KAP scores. High education and high earnings also contributed to lower risk to CVD. Respondents who were active at work were better in attitude assessment. The result of the correlation between knowledge, attitude and practice showed that there was significant difference between the knowledge score points and attitude level (p-value: 0.0444) and also between the attitude and practice level (p-value: 0.0208) of the respondents. Despite the gaps in KAP measurement, respondents showed interest in cholesterol lowering interventions. Further studies are therefore necessary to fill with a more concrete resolution.",

    "abstract": "The study aimed to assess the level of wet market vendors’ awareness on handling practices of local cured meat products including longganisa and tocino at selected areas in Laguna. The residual nitrite contents of longganisa and tocino were determined through spectrophotometric analysis, and results were evaluated in relation to the data gathered from the survey. The lack of knowledge on proper meat handling and processing was reflected on both the results of the survey and the analysis. Among the 43 collected samples, though only 53% were declared to have added nitrite, 81% were found to contain nitrite. Wet market longganisa samples contain 1-344 ppm residual nitrite, while tocino has 0-104. Meanwhile, three branded samples, with 100% nitrite declaration, were found to have 4- 48 ppm nitrite for longganisa and 30-123 ppm for tocino. The data obtained also showed that the products were generally within the standard limits set by BFAD (2006). However, these values were less than the 80-140 ppm requirement for effective inhibition of spoilage bacteria. The variability and low levels of residual nitrite were indicative of the inconsistent product quality on those produced from the wet market, thus highlighting the need for training. The effect of post-production conditions or pre-consumption processes, including, storage time, condition, and cooking were also evaluated. Nitrite depletion during storage was confirmed, and the degree of nitrite loss was greater in chilled storage condition than in frozen. Results also showed that cooking lowered the residual nitrite of longganisa by 15% with pan-frying, 33% with boiling and frying, and 38% with extended pan-frying methods.",

This study aims to develop a loaf bread with nutritional significance utilizing nixtamalized corn/wheat flour blends. This will promote its consumption and subsequently contribute in the improvement of Filipinos’ nutritional status. This study analyzed the proximate composition and selected mineral content of the pulverized nixtamalized corn kernel. The developed loaf bread with corn and wheat flour blend was analyzed for its proximate composition, selected mineral content, sensory characteristics and acceptability. Results showed that the pulverized nixtamalized corn kernel had significant increase for moisture content while there is a significant decrease in crude protein, total ash, and carbohydrate. Using the response surface methodology, the optimum nixtamalized corn and wheat flour blend is 5:95. The developed loaf bread from the optimum blend was acceptable to the consumers and had no significant difference with the loaf bread made of pure bread flour. In conclusion, nixtamalization technology has improved the nutritional quality of IPB var 6 corn specifically in terms of crude fiber, ash, calcium, and iron, Loaf bread is already part of the Filipino diet hence, introducing a familiar product but with improved nutritional",

    "abstract": "One of the essential parts of ecosystem diversity are the mosses. Mosses are often used as plant indicators for climate change due to their sensitivity to environmental changes. There is a lack of bryophyte literature in Mt. Makiling, hence, there is a need for published works documenting the moss flora of Mt. Makiling. This study aimed to evaluate moss species richness, composition and distribution along the altitudinal gradients of Makiling and Sipit trails. It also intended to determine the effects of the different environmental factors to moss flora diversity in Mt. Makiling. The study was conducted in Mt. Makiling Forest Reserve (MMEFR) to compare the diversity of mosses along an altitudinal gradients in the Sipit and Makiling trails. Sampling plots were established every 100 masl elevation. Moss specimens were collected inside a 100 m? plot and were re-examined under dissecting and compound microscope. Quantitative determination of light intensity, relative humidity and temperature was undertaken. A total of 77 moss species belonging to 17 families were identified in plots established in two forest trails in MMFR, with 43 and 48 species from Makiling and Sipit trail, respectively. In Makiling trail, the highest species diversity was found in 900 mas| while in Sipit trail, the most diverse quadrat was observed in 1,000 masl. Sampling plots located at higher elevations tend to have more number of species compared to the sampling plots at lower elevations. Low species richness in lower elevation can be explained by more disturbance compared with higher elevation. Furthermore, species richness, diversity and abundance increases with increasing elevation, RH and light intensity. In contrast, higher temperature decreases species richness, diversity and abundance. Moss species did not differ between trail communities, and not affected by changes in temperature, RH and light intensity. In general, moss diversity is positively affected by increasing elevation in both trails. This is also supported by correlation analysis on moss species composition for the two sampling sites while sudden decreases in diversity in sampling plots located at 600 mas! and 900 masl (Sipit Trail) and 800 mas! and 1,000 masl (Makiling Trail) could simply be due to the presence of canopy gaps or disturbances in the site.",

    "abstract": "Tropical deforestation is among the significant processes of land cover change. In monitoring deforestation, remotely sensed data played a crucial role in understanding the extent of forest depletion. However, in tropical countries like the Philippines, generation of spatially explicit forest cover data are hindered by multiple imagery sources, varying scales and resolutions, undisclosed methods of mapping and different forest classes and definitions used. In this study, the main objectives were to identify the trends of forest cover change in the Philippines using Landsat processed data from years 2000-2012 and to validate its causes in the field. The data were enhanced and further analyzed to make sure that forest pixels fall within acceptable tree cover and non-forests features were excluded. Then post-processing was done to produce net change ranking and annual forest loss rates, trends and correlations. The said step was also done per forest cover type to provide detailed insights on forest cover change. The results showed that MIMAROPA had the highest forest loss rate (2,864.10 ha/year), followed by Cagayan Valley (2,550.82 ha/yr) and CARAGA (2,522.56 ha/yr). Zamboanga Peninsula region had the highest mean aggregate net change (or percent net change) of -7.18% with mean forest loss rate of 1,294.40 ha/year followed by CALABARZON (-3.41% with mean forest loss rate of 1,098.54 ha/year) and CARAGA (-3.16%). However, only CARAGA had the significant Positive trend of forest loss (r = 0.69, p-value < 0.05). In the provincial level, Palawan had the highest forest loss rate (2,380.02 ha/yr), followed by Agusan del Sur (1,693.86ha/yr) and Cagayan (1,018.23 ha/yr). Zamboanga Sibugay had the highest mean aggregate net change (- 8.94%, mean forest loss rate = 233.05 ha/year) followed by Zamboanga del Norte (-8.10%, mean forest loss rate = 812.02 ha/year and Albay (-4.98%, mean forest loss rate = 99.81 ha/year. Open forest (secondary growth) was the most dynamic forest type with national mean forest loss rate of 613.19 ha/yr and mean aggregate net change of -2.75%. Likewise, Agusan del Sur (0.68), Tarlac (0.67) and Davao Oriental (0.65) were the top provinces which had significant increasing trend of forest loss (p-value < 0.05) in open forest. The overall accuracies for Landsat processed data were 86.48% for loss and 92.26% for gain, but this varied greatly per biogeographic region. On the other hand, key indirect drivers such as forest product harvesting (logging and timber poaching; weighted score = 14.75), and agriculture (kaingin and forest to rubber plantation conversion; ws = 18) were identified as main reasons of deforestation in General Nakar, Quezon and Kabasalan, Zamboanga Sibugay, respectively. Meanwhile, agriculture (kaingin) and forest product harvesting (logging and timber poaching) were tied in Siocon, Zamboanga del Norte (ws = 13.5). However, biophysical drivers such as landslides and drought served as push factors to intensify the said proximate causes as observed in General Nakar and Kabasalan. Economic-market driven factors (limited livelihood opportunities and high demand for wood) were identified as the main indirect driver of forest decline in three sites. Specific events such as global financial crisis, policy changes, log bans, cutting and logging permits issuance were identified as another underlying causes of forest decline in validated sites. On the other hand, in relating Landsat derived data to various forestry statistics, it was found out that annual lumber production (r = 0.66) and roundwood production (r= 0.62) were significantly and moderately correlated to forest loss while CBFM (r = -0.59) areas had negative association to forest loss (p-value < 0.05). In this research, areas with significant forest change were identified and key deforestation drivers were analyzed with the aid of the Landsat processed data. This study demonstrated that remote sensing data coupled with socio-economic based ground validation for selected sites further enhanced our understanding of the complex processes of deforestation.",

The first study was accomplished from February to November 2014 comprising three batches of sows (batch 1= 99; batch 2=91; batch 3=77) at different parities. Results showed that for batch 1, late parity sows (above 5) from ECS obtained 3.6d earlier weaning to service interval (WSI). Also, late parity sows in batch 2, from ECS obtained higher total pigs bom (TPB) and litter size born alive (LSB), ie. 2.85 and 2.7, respectively (P<0.05). Comparable results were observed for batch 3 in all sow productivity parameters. Batches 2 and 3 i.e. from April to November obtained a THI value of 76 - 84 in ECS while non- ECS obtained 79 - 87.5. Sows of batches 2 and 3 even in ECS experienced stress, suggesting limited benefit of ECS. The second study involved video monitoring of behavior for 3 days in each THI set-up. The plasma, pulse, respiration, rectal temperature and feed intake were sampled at 0700 and 1500 hours of the first day exposure to a given THI set-up. The plasma HSP 70 was elevated (P<0.05) at THI 71 (3.42 to 3.46 ng/l), indicative of stress. The respiration rate increased significantly beyond THI 77. The interaction of period of the day and temperature humidity index shows that at THI 77, morning and afternoon meals are significantly lower than THI 71. Therefore, cumulative average morning or afternoon meal intake duration lower 2250 seconds (37minutes) is the best indicator of stress in gilts.",

One representative chemical from each class was selected: Dichlorovinyl Dimethyl Phosphate (DDVP) from organophosphates, propoxur from carbamates, α-cypermethrin from synthetic pyrethroids, fipronil from phenyl pyrazoles and thiamethoxam from neonicotinoids. The six-week-old nymphs of German cockroach were bio-assayed against these insecticides using the WHO glass jar method, with slight modifications, to determine the LC₅₀ values and slope after conducting probit analysis. The two most toxic chemicals were fipronil and thiamethoxam. Propoxur was more toxic than a-cypermethrin. DDVP was consistently the least toxic against German cockroaches coming from all collection sites. This suggests that the older classes (OPs, carbamates and pyrethroids) which have been used through time have shown reduced efficacy against German cockroach compared to the newer compounds.",

    "abstract": "This piece of work described pre-service biology teachers (PSBTs) in terms of their exposure to inquiry-based science instruction (IBSI), and how they were able to apply IBSI practices during teaching practicum. Moreover, the study profiled the PSBTs according to their IBSI understanding, attitudes, sett-efficacy, and predispositions, including their learner-centered views. Finally, the study determined the inter-relationships among the PSBTs' IBSI variables. Sixty-six (66) PSBTs from three teacher-education institutions in Baguio City and Benguet participated in the study. Eight instruments were used to gather data -Science Teachers’ Inquiry Practices Scale (STIPS), Pedagogy of Science Testing Test - Biology Items (POSTT-B), Attitude Scale for IBSI Use (ASIU), Inquiry-Based Science Instruction Self-efficacy Scale (IBSISES), Test for Inquiry Pedagogy in Science — Biology (TIPS-B), Modified Reformed Teaching Observation Protocol (mRTOP), Modified Inquiry Teaching Self-Assessment Instrument (mITSAl), and the Educational Philosophies Self-Assessment Instrument (EPSAI). The PSBTs lesson plans were also analyzed to support the result on the level of IBSI application during teaching internship. Follow-up interviews on both PSBTs and their cooperating teachers were also conducted to supplement the quantitative results gathered from the research instruments. Descriptive statistics (mean and standard deviation) were used to summarize data, while inferential statistics (Analysis of Variance and Tukey HSD) were used to test for significance among means. Pearson correlation and step-wise multiple regression procedures were employed to describe the relationship among the PSBTs' IBSI variables. Based on the findings, the study concludes that the PSBTs were sufficiently exposed to IBSI in all of its aspects — lesson planning and implementation, content knowledge, and classroom culture. They possessed a strong IBSI foundation which was built not only during their collage science courses but also during their field study experiences and even during their pre-college science courses. While their BSI knowledge and understanding were both insufficient, they nevertheless hold a very positive attitude toward the teaching approach, even regarding it as useful, interesting, and likable. The PSBTs highly adhere to the learner-centered philosophies, specifically constructivism and progressivism. They are highly selt-efficacious toward IBSI specifically along classroom culture, but are moderately predisposed to select IBSI teaching practices among other pedagogical methods and techniques. Finally, the PSBTs were able to apply IBSI practices during teaching internship sufficiently. As to the relationship among the variables, the PSBTs' learner-centered views significantly correlated with their IBSI understanding and attitude, while attitude, self-efficacy, and learner-centered views significantly correlated with IBSI application during teaching internship. Moreover, the PSBTs' progressivist views significantly predicted their IBSI attitudes, and their IBSI exposure at field study was the only predictor of their IBSI self-efficacy. Meanwhile, IBSI understanding during lesson proper, and IBSI self-efficacy along classroom culture emerged as the significant predictors of IBSI predisposition. Finally, IBS! exposure at field study, IBS! understanding during lesson proper, overall IBSI attitudes, progressivist views, and overall IBSI self-efficacy, significantly predicted IBSI application during teaching internship. Of these variables, overall, IBSI self-efficacy was the best predictor of IBSI application, followed by the PSBTs' progressivist views. It is recommended that science professors should team up with science education professors in further strengthening the inquiry foundations of pre-service science students. Science education professors may emphasize the true nature of IBSI in their science teaching methods courses. Pre-service science teachers may be given more time to observe and experience inquiry practices in actual classes. Furthermore, some of the instruments used in this study could be polished so that they will effectively measure the constructs they are intended to measure. A more direct data- gathering procedure such as lesson plan analysis and/or actual teaching observation is likewise recommended for future researchers who want to duplicate this study. Moreover, syllabi and/or their laboratory manuals may also be analyzed as to how they emphasize on IBSI. Pre-service science teachers may also be exposed to the practices of lesson study, emphasizing on IBSI to instill its principles and practices better. For future research, the IBSI implementation among in-service teachers, how Filipino pre-service teachers implement IBSI practices during the first three years of teaching, how experiences or exposure with IBSI affect pre-service and in-service science teachers’ basic and integrated science process skills and scientific literacy, among others, may be explored.",

PCR-RFLP genotyping of a Philippine population of Holstein x Jersey crossbreds showed that CSN3 A and B alleles, as well as BLG A and B alleles, were almost equal in frequencies. Both loci had genotypic frequencies that showed no significant departure from the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. Univariate and multiple regression analyses demonstrated that CSN3 A allele was significantly associated with higher ADMY (average daily milk yield), FC (fat content), FY (fat yield), and LC (lactose content) while CSN3 B was associated with higher PC (protein content) and PFR (protein-to-fat ratio). On the other hand, BLG B was found to significantly associated with ADMY and FY. The interaction of the two loci had some effect on PMY (peak milk yield). Cows with CSN3-BLG genotype combination of ABBB were observed to have a significant increase in PMY. Moreover, phylogenetic analysis of the complete coding sequence and promoter region of BLG grouped the taxa in agreement with the current taxonomy of the 13 selected eutherian taxa. However, there was no clear separation of the taxa according to milk protein, fat and lactose composition. Further evolutionary analysis identified codon sites under positive and negative selection, supporting the proposed transport function of BLG. Lastly, two out of 10 conserved motifs identified in the promoter region of the BLG were shown to be putative transcription factor binding sites which may regulate gene expression that may consequently affect milk production.",

    "abstract": "The COVID-19 pandemic occurred unexpectedly, which inevitably affected the daily lives of people, including efforts by BNSs in eradicating malnutrition in the barangays. This study determined the factors affecting the performance of Barangay Nutrition Scholars (BNS) in Laguna, Philippines during the COVID-19 pandemic. Face- to-face survey using semi-structured interview schedule was used to understand the experiences of the BNSs. Results revealed that the frequency of performance of all roles and functions became less frequent during the pandemic, with coordination and implementation having significant changes. Specific personal-related factors found to have association with performance change included BNSs’ marital status, household income and health and well-being, while work-related factors found to have association included training or preparedness, workload, community participation, guidelines, and resources. Identified facilitators to success in performance during the pandemic were supportive supervision from the barangay and the MNAO and teamwork and unity among colleagues. Meanwhile, barriers to performance were COVID-19-related factors and lack of community participation. Findings from this study showed that the performance of BNSs were affected by different factors during the pandemic, thus these factors as well as the facilitators and barriers identified should be considered in planning and delivery of nutrition services in the community during similar events in the future.",

High intakes of processed, fried, sugary, salty, and fatty foods were found to increase the risk of developing NCDs. This study determined the readiness to change dietary behaviors among 247 adult women with NCDs from Parafiaque City and the factors that affect this readiness to change using online data collection. Results showed that majority of the participants’ stages of readiness to change dietary behaviors in terms of consumption of fruits, sugar, salt and oil were in pre-contemplation, while most of the participants were in action stage for vegetable consumption. Diagnosis of CVD, food preference and frequency consumption tended to affect their readiness to change. Household environment that includes purchasing power and support of household members likewise played a vital role. Moreover, affordability was found to be an apparent hindrance for change for all participants, specifically those in the pre- contemplation stage. The study showed that assessing the readiness to change dietary behaviors of adult women with NCDs can serve as basis in designing the appropriate contextualized interventions with appropriate goals and action steps for the different stages of change for each participant.",

    "abstract": "A study to determine the conchological features of golden apple snails (Pomacea canaliculata [Lamarck, 1822]) was conducted in selected rice fields of Davao City. Five sites were selected as sampling areas: Buhangin, Tugbok, Calinan, Baguio, and Marilog. Sampling was done between January and February 2022. The method used to collect golden apple snails was the handpicking method, with a 30 mm lower limit on size for samples collected to exclude juveniles. A total of 23 specimens were randomly collected from each site. The physicochemical parameters measured were within normal ranges and suitable for the growth of rice and P. canaliculata. The correlation between the variables was determined using Bayesian correlation analysis. Among the relationships studied, shell width-salinity, aperture length-salinity, number of whorls-salinity, shell dry weight~ salinity, shell length-salinity, shell length-temperature, shell width-temperature, and number of whorls-temperature reported a positive correlation with BF₊₀ values greater than 3.000, indicating that there is substantial evidence in favor of the alternative hypothesis that there is an association between the variables. The increased activity of the golden apple snail as the temperature rises, as well as its high salinity tolerance, are suggested to be contributing factors to the positive correlations. It is recommended that a more extensive correlation study of P. canaliculata in the Davao Region be conducted using Bayesian statistics.",

    "abstract": "Calamansi (x Citrofortunella microcarpa (Bunge) Wijnands) is a highly seasonal crop with peak production during rainy months when the farmgate price of calamansi is meager, prompting many farmers to abandon calamansi production altogether. Because there is a high price of calamansi during the off-season, this study examined how to extend the availability or the harvest season of calamansi to catch higher prices during the lean season. The hypothesis tested was that calamansi will also respond to the gibberellic acid application like other Citrus species in retarding ripening for one to three months while still attached to the tree; this has come to be known as “on-tree storage.” A study on reproductive phenology was done to determine at what stage of fruit development would be ideal for the treatment application. GA₃ can be applied 108 days from inflorescence emergence during the wet season, or when fruits tum dark green, the peel is porous and reached 90-100% (23-27 mm) of their final size. Three different GA₃ concentrations were tested: 10, 20, and 40 ppm. The first foliar treatment of GA₃; was made before the fruits have reached color break (BBCH Stage 79 and 80). Application at 10 and 20 ppm were able to maintain the mature green stage and extend the harvest period for a month or 35 days with less than 17.5% fruits having a tinge of yellow. At 40 ppm, the mature green stage was extended even longer to 46 days and showed no signs of color break. A second application was done for all treatments when some fruits already had a color break, however, the fruits did not revert to green color. The second application of GA₃ at 40 ppm extended the harvest season to 63 days where approximately only one-fourth of the fruits were at color break stage. Moreover, up to 90% of the fruits were retained, had thinner peels and decreased rind ageing, while fruit firmness, total soluble solids and titratable acidity remained unaffected.",

A focus group discussions (FGD) were done to investigate the practices of the beneficiary households in terms of cash transfers management. The study also used secondary data to determine the height and weight of the children (6 to 60 months old) and describe their nutritional status. And lastly, the study determine the food expenditure and household dietary diversity score (HDDS) of the households through survey. Findings show that the beneficiary households mainly allot the cash transfers they received for school, health and nutrition of their children. With respect to the nutritional status of the children, frequency analysis suggest that there is a higher prevalence of malnutrition among beneficiary households. On the other hand, survey results showed that beneficiary households spend more on food (absolute value) and have more diverse diet when compared using T-test for independent samples. The association of the socio-economic and demographic profile with the food expenditure and dietary diversity of the households were also analyzed using correlation analysis. The results suggest that beneficiary households spend more on food and have more diverse diet with a higher household size and income. Findings also imply that those who live in urban areas tend to have higher food expenditure compared to those who live in rural areas. Moreover, those who live in rural areas tend to have higher HDDS than those who live in urban areas. Finally, female-headed households, as well as whose finances were managed by a family member with higher educational attainment, tend to have more diverse diet. These findings imply that there are still problems to be addressed, especially in the nutrition aspect of the program in the area.",

Thus, the study attempted to evaluate the soil quality of the banana, calamansi, coffee, and rambutan plantations in the northern part of Luzon, Philippines; and assessed whether there is a degree of degradation or improvement of these plantations from the reference forest through the use of a soil quality index (SQI) approach. SQl is a viable tool to evaluate soil quality that integrates various soil properties into a valuc that can be easily interpreted and provide support to management decisions. Soil quality was evaluated within the 0-30 cm and 30-60 cm soil depths, employing 15 different soil physical, chemical, and biological indicators that individually showed distinct responses to plantation establishment. A combined data from both depths, forming the 0-60 cm depth, was also included in the analysis. It was found that the soil quality of the various sites was graded from low to high, regardless of soil depth. With reference to the secondary forest, Tesults revealed that the soil quality in the banana plantation declined while in the calamansi, coffee and rambutan plantations were improved within the upper (0-30 cm) soil depth. Inversely, only the banana plantation has increased the quality of the soil in the lower (30-60 cm) soil depth, while the quality of the soil within the calamansi, coffee, and rambutan plantations was decreased. For the total (0-60 cm) soil depth, only the coffee plantation has caused an improved soil quality compared to the reference forest. In the opposite manner, the banana, calamansi, and rambutan plantations have caused a decrease in the quality of the soil. Across sites and soil depths, the physical indicator highly contributing to the SQI value was the water holding capacity. Cation exchange capacity and exchangeable potassium also highly influenced the SQI value of the different sites compared to other chemical indicators. While the earthworm and bacteria counts were the biological propertics that showed high contributions to the SQI values.",

Carrying capacity assessment offers a practical and effective tool for tourism destination stakeholders to help attain sustainable tourism. The resort’s physical and social carrying capacities were assessed during the peak days of Christmas break in 2013 extending to February 2014. Adapting Cifuentes’ (1992) formulae adjusted by Tran et al. (2007), the estimated daily effective real carrying capacity of the swimming pools was 443 bathers. Records confirm that there were days that it was exceeded. Social carrying capacity was assessed through evaluation of recreation satisfaction of visitors and determination of residents’ attitude towards tourism exploring the Doxey’s Irridex using semi-structured survey questionnaires. Despite some deficiencies in the resort, visitors were generally satisfied with their vacation while residents are at the stage of euphoria. Thus, the social carrying capacity of the resort is not exceeded at present. Validation of the standard user requirement of the 2012 ISPSC using visual approach revealed that it was not applicable to the visitor-respondents of the resort.",

    "abstract": "A transactional approach was employed to explore the underlying reasons behind the current solid waste management practices of the municipality of Pila. As representatives for the upland, urban, and lakeshore communities, respondents from Pansol, Sta. Clara Sur, Pinagbayanan were surveyed. Also, a KII and secondary data analysis were done. It was found that majority of the respondents declared that they practice segregation, 3Rs, and are refraining from burning waste. However, some are still not practicing proper management. Also, their waste disposal practices vary Consequently, the respondents are knowledgeable on proper waste Management and laws; and have positive attitude towards proper waste management. Moreover, it was observed that the history of land use and solid waste ordinances affect the respondents’ practices. The different landscapes of Pila, its residential and municipal waste facilities, in connection with their practices, were also identified. Therefore, their practices can be explained through the interplay of psychological processes, physical environment, and temporal qualities. By understanding these relationships, strategies were formulated to aid the municipality towards an improved solid waste management. In general, recommendations address issues on the knowledge and attitude of the respondents, the improvement of their physical setting, and enactment or amendment of municipal ordinances.",

    "abstract": "Salinity is a major abiotic stress affecting plant growth and productivity. Rice cultivars exhibit variable responses to salinity depending on the developmental stage they have been exposed. In this study, physiological changes in leaves and developing panicles of six rice (Oryza sativa L.) cultivars (IR68652-3B-8-1, Sadri, CSR28, IR67075-2B-5-2 including the sensitive-check Rc222 and the tolerant-check Pokkali) contrasting in salt tolerance were evaluated in greenhouse experiment under salt stress. Phenotypic responses were assessed at seedling and reproductive stages using a visual scoring system. Vegetative and reproductive parts were collected at four developmental stages (booting, flowering, milk stage and mature grain stages) and analyzed for changes in concentrations of Na⁺ and K⁺, chlorophyll, malondialdehyde (MDA), ascorbate and proline and also for pollen viability, grain yield, and yield components. The results showed that IR686 and Sadri were sensitive while CSR28 and IR670 were moderately tolerant to salt stress (EC = 10 dS m⁻¹) at the seedling stage. During the reproductive stage, Sadri was more sensitive to salt stress than IR686, while CSR28 and IR670 remained moderately tolerant. Under salt stress and at all developmental stages, IR670 and Pokkali showed lower Na⁺/K⁺ ratio, lower reduction in chlorophyll concentration, lower MDA, higher concentrations of reduced ascorbate, higher proline accumulation, and lower percentage reduction in pollen viability than salt- sensitive cultivars. The higher levels of reduced ascorbate indicate an efficient reactive oxygen species scavenging machinery, which is important to overcome salinity-induced oxidative stress. These data indicate that salt-tolerance in rice cultivars used in this study is associated with lower Na⁺/K⁺ ratio, smaller reductions in chlorophyll concentration, ascorbate concentration, pollen viability and yield components, and lower MDA concentration but enhanced proline accumulation in vegetative and reproductive parts in comparison with salt-sensitive ones. Salt stress substantially reduced yield components, which is more evident in Rc222, IR686 and Sadri. Physiological measurements, pollen viability analysis and yield components revealed that Sadri, which was previously reported as moderately tolerant at seedling stage is sensitive to salt stress at reproductive stage.",

The excitation power dependence of the THz emission was determined. Moreover, we analyzed the experimental results through an equivalent circuit model (ECM) which accounts for the (i) photogeneration, (ii) screening effects, and (iii) transport of car- riers of the PCA. In modeling the THz mechanism at above-bandgap excitation we used the direct bandgap excitation model which takes into account the single photon absorption (SPA) and two photon absorption (TPA) for both PCAs. Meanwhile, at below-bandgap we followed and modified the two-step photoabsorption via mid-gap states model. The good fit of the numerical results with the experimental THz emis- sion power dependence reveal that at above-bandgap excitation, combined SPA and TPA is the primary mechanism responsible for THz emission for both PCAs. Sim- ilarly, the model used at the below-bandgap excitation for both PCAs was able to replicate the experimental THz emission power dependence. Hence, we conclude that the dominant THz emission mechanism for both SI- and LT-GaAs at below-bandgap regime is the two-step photoabsorption via mid-gap states.",

    "abstract": "Deep neural networks have achieved impressive pattern recognition and generative abilities on complex tasks by developing larger and deeper models, which are increasingly costly to train and implement. There is in tandem interest to develop sparse versions of these powerful models by post-processing with weight pruning or dynamic sparse training. However, these processes require expensive train-prune-finetune cycles and compromise the trainability of very deep network configurations. We introduce sparsity-aware orthogonal initialization (SAO), a method to initialize sparse but maximally connected neural networks with orthogonal weights. SAO constructs a sparse network topology leveraging Ramanujan expander graphs to assure connectivity and assigns orthogonal weights to attain approximate dynamical isometry. We implemented SAO to multilayer perceptrons and demonstrated that SAO networks outperform magnitude pruning in very deep and sparse networks up to a thousand layers with fewer computations and training iterations. Meanwhile, in convolutional neural networks within the SAO framework, kernels may be removed prior to model training based on a desired compression factor rather than post-training based on parameter-dependent heuristics. SAO is parameter-efficient, exhibiting the potential for applications with tight energy and computation budgets such as edge computing tasks, because it achieves sparse, trainable neural network models with fewer learnable parameters without requiring special layers, additional training, scaling, or regularization. The advantages of SAO networks are attributed to both its sparse but maximally connected topology and orthogonal weight initialization.",

Moench) on growth performance, relative organ weights, nutrient digestibility, and energy concentration in broilers. A total of 60 day-old (Cobb 500) broilers were used for the metabolic experiment. Birds were randomly allotted to 1 of 5 dietary treatments using a completely randomized design arranged in a 2 x 2 factorial arrangements plus the basal diet. A corn-soybean meal basal diet and 4 diets were formulated by mixing 70% of the basal diet with 30% (as-fed basis) of ground white sorghum, whole white sorghum, ground red sorghum, and whole red sorghum, respectively. Significant interaction (P = 0.01) between variety and form of grain sorghum was observed only for F/G. Broilers fed with red grain sorghum have better F/G (P = 0.10) compared with white grain sorghum when offered as whole grain, but both were not significantly different from those fed ground sorghum and the corn-soy diet. Variety of sorghum grain did not affect LW of broiler at slaughter. Relative weight of gizzard and ' proventriculus were greater (P < 0.005) in broilers fed whole sorghum. ATTD of DM was greater (P = 0.002) in diets with sorghum compared with the corn-soy diet regardless of the variety and physical form of sorghum. The ATTD of CP tended to be lower (P < 0.001) in the diet with white sorghum compared with red sorghum. The ATTD of GE and AME of diet were not significantly affected by variety and form of sorghum grain. On DM basis, the AME and AMEn of red and white sorghum (3,683 and 3,575 kcal/kg DM and 3,521 and 3,414 kcal/kg DM, respectively) and ground and whole sorghum (3,535 and 3,723 kcal/kg DM and 3,373 and 3,561 kcal/kg DM, respectively) were not significantly different in broilers. The results have shown that variety of sorghum in growth performance is more likely similar. It also shows that feeding whole sorghum grain stimulates gizzard activity and development as implied by the increase in relative weight of gizzard. However, whole grain feeding did not significantly improve energy utilization in broilers. Key words: sorghum grain, broilers, growth performance, nutrient digestibility energy concentration",

    "abstract": "In the framework of space-fractional quantum mechanics, systems with mul- tiple Dirac-δ and locally periodic potentials are studied. First, bound states for multiple Dirac-δ wells with uniform strength are considered and analyzed using the momentum-space (Fourier transform) approach. A matrix formulation that facilitates the analysis of bound states for this system is presented. This matrix formulation is applied to derive expressions satisfied by the bound-state energies of N = 1,2,3 6-function wells. Known results for single and double delta wells are recovered. The case of a triple Dirac-δ well extends the application of the proposed matrix method. It is shown that obtaining bound states for higher numbers of Dirac-δ wells is concep- tually straightforward from the matrix eigenvalue equation derived. The bound-state wave functions are expressed in terms of Fox’s H-function. Second, transmission through locally periodic potentials is analyzed using the piecewise approach. In particular, transmission probabilities T(N) for a particle in a chain of N Dirac-δ barriers and for a particle in a chain of N square barriers are calculated. A transfer-matrix approach in the context of fractional quantum mechanics is adapted together with the jump condition for the fractional derivative of a wave function. For N > 1 plots of T(N) for both barrier systems exhibit hill-like (or plateau-like) and valley-like structures for a certain range of energies FE. The numbers of these structures increase as the fractal order (Lévy index) α decreases. Also observed in the case of Dirac-δ multibarrier system is the presence of undulations in each hill-like structure, which is related to the number of barriers by N — 1, independent on the value of α. Emergence of bandlike structures for as low as N = 4 barriers, which is known to be a characteristic of periodic potentials, is also seen. These bandlike structures are more apparent as the number of undulations in each hill increases and are more apparent for lower values of α. Third, special cases of Dirac-δ potentials with non-uniform strengths are consid- ered. Specifically, the space-fractional Schrédinger equation with a dipolar double Dirac-δ potential and the one with a quadrupolar triple Dirac-δ potential are solved. The momentum-space approach is used in the analysis, which is divided into two cases: E < 0 for bound state and E ≥ 0 for scattering state. The wave functions for both potentials are expressed in terms of Fox’s H-function. Graphical analysis reveals only one unique bound-state eigenenergy α for each potential, which shifts to higher values as α decreases. The corresponding wave functions are found to be antisymmetric for the dipolar potential and, with the particular choice W = Z for these parameters, symmetric for the quadrupolar potential. The scattering-state wave functions for the two systems are also obtained as precursors to analyzing scattering properties of these potentials.",

The thesis investigates a particular class of uniserial modules over a ring. In particular, it will be shown that if the ring is infinite, simple and von Neu- mann regular, then the theory of modules over this ring has elementary equivalent models. An application of this result is given. Conversely, it is shown that with the assumption that every ideal of the ring is an elementary substructure of the ring as a module over itself, we have that the ring must be infinite, simple and von Neumann regular. It is also shown that the prescribed conditions are strictly insufficient for isomorphism.

Acute toxicity was conducted in male and female ICR mice following the OECD Guidelines 425 (2008) to evaluate its safety profile. For the in-vivo efficacy, mice were randomly allocated to five groups fed with various diets ad libitum for nine weeks as follows: Group 1: normal diet (ND) and served as the control; Group 2: high-fat diet (HFD), that served as negative control; Group 3: HFD + 10% w/w FDD powder; Group 4: HFD + 20% w/w FDD powder; and Group 5: HFD + 30% w/w FDD powder. Proximate composition of FDD fruit flesh includes 20.16 ± 0.75% moisture content, 2.64 ± 0.06% total crude fiber, 4.50 ± 0.21% crude fat, 7.10 ± 0.20% crude protein and 62.22 + 1.11% carbohydrate. It is a rich source of antioxidants with a total flavonoid content (TFC) of 0.02 mg QE/g FDD, total phenolic content of 12.52 ± 0.02 mg GAE/g FDD and anti-oxidant activity of 96.07 ± 0.86. Result of the in vitro lipid lowering activity showed that FDD has 15.03% bile acid binding capacity, 43.61% cholesterol micellar inhibition and 11.09% pancreatic lipase inhibition capacity. Acute toxicity findings reveal that FDD does not exert acute toxic effects by oral administration as shown by the histology, hematology and biochemical findings measured at the end of the treatment, suggesting that oral supplementation of FDD is relatively safe with an estimated LD₅₀ value of >5000 mg/kg in treated ICR mice. Results of the in vivo study showed a significant reduction in blood TG by 50% at 30% FDD supplementation (w/w) and by 30% at 20% FDD supplementation (w/w) (p<0.05). Significant increase up to 45% in HDL-C in 30% FDD-supplemented group was noted compared to the baseline mean (week 0) at week 3 and week 6 of supplementation (p<0.05). Meanwhile, no significant findings were noted in the blood TC levels. The improvement in lipid profile could be attributed to the nutritional and bioactive compounds found in Philippine duhat.

    "abstract": "The emergence of the Casing While Drilling (CWD) for the simultaneous borehole drilling and installation of the casing pipe has brought into attention one of its inherent benefits which is the plastering effect. This effect involves the smearing of the mud cake and cuttings into the surrounding formation as the rotating casing pipe hits the surface of the borehole, thus creating an impermeable layer which prevents fluid loss. This warrants further investigation on parameters that affect the formation of the mud cake as it plays a crucial role on plastering effect. This study utilizes computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations that implements a Eulerian-Eulerian two-fluid model using ANSYS CFX-18.2 to observe the effects of the particle size distribution (45 µm to 5000 µm) of the cuttings produced during casing while drilling together with the rotation speed (0 rpm to 80 rpm) of the casing pipe. A total of 20 simulations was made having different combinations of particle sizes and rotation speeds. The formation of the mud cake which is the main material used during plastering effect is the response that was observed from the contributions of different particle sizes and rotation speeds together with their interactions. It was found that the particle size distribution is a significant factor in the formation of the mud cake with a p-value of 0.048, showing that increasing particle size tends to increase the response. Results have shown that the 2000 µm particle size produced the highest average mud cake thickness. On the other hand, rotation speed was not found to be a significant contributor to the formation of the mud cake with a p-value of 0.134. It was also found that the interaction between the particle size and rotation speed was not a significant factor in the formation of the mud cake with a p-value of 0.945. The average mud cake thickness obtained from the simulations and the regression equation showed a spread of values within a ±5% range.",

    "abstract": "The Malabeg prospect is one of the few reported peridotite-hosted gold and base metal vein-type mineralization within the Cabangan Massif, Zambales Ophiolite Complex. Mineralization is associated with NW-trending quartz-adularia veins along contacts between the middle Eocene serpentinized harzburgites and Late Oligocene to Late Eocene diabases of the Cabangan Massif and in open spaces within host rocks, wherein veins and floats have gold concentrations up to 74.5 ppm. Four stages of alteration and mineralization were determined for the Malabeg prospect. Stage 1 consists of talc-carbonate alteration of the serpentinized peridotites. Stage 2 consists of dolomite veins found adjacent to host rocks. Stage 3 consists of quartz-carbonate veins, where thombic boundaries are observed between quartz and calcite. Arsenopyrite is present in Stages 2- 3. Stage 4 consists of quartz-adularia exhibiting massive, comb and brecciated textures. Ore mineralogy consists of chalcopyrite + galena + sphalerite ± pyrite ± pyrrhotite ± electrum. Supergene alteration is represented by iron oxides ranging from limonite to hematite, pyrolusite and secondary chalcocite, aside from the thin laterite capping the ultramafic regolith. Six electrum grains in Stage 4 quartz-adularia reveal an average composition of 74.33% Au and 21.55% Ag. Mean iron-sulfide mole percent for nine sphalerite points coexisting with pyrite or pyrrhotite is 14.91. Two-phase fluid inclusions in Stage 4 quartz-adularia reveal bimodal homogenization temperatures range from 170 to 180 °C and 190 to 200 °C while salinity values range from 1.4 to 10.23 wt.% NaCl. From these, depths of 67-144 meters below the paleo-water table was estimated while the trend of values plotted on the homogenization temperature versus salinity graph is inconclusive. An intermediate sulfidation state is recognized for the Malabeg prospect, which is supported by ore assemblage, sphalerite mineral chemistry and fluid inclusion properties. The results suggest initial pulses intermediate sulfidation (IS) fluids from a nearby magmatic source related to the Bataan Volcanic Arc. Fluid-rock reaction with the serpentinized harzburgites, together with evolved fluids, produced listwanitization (Stages 1-3), while the high buffering capacity of the host rocks lowered the sulfidation state of the system and precipitated arsenopyrite along with the initial quartz-carbonate veins. Faulting and reaction-induced self- cracking within listwanites promoted growth of open spaces in structurally weak planes that served as loci for the precipitation of the succeeding IS fluids into Stage 4 quartz-adularia veins. Shift towards an oxidizing environment produced supergene alteration minerals such as hematite, pyrolusite and secondary chalcocite. Ore content along the various lithologies also suggest different affinities for transport and precipitation. As, Zn, Co, Cr and Ni peak in Stages 1-3 which may have been precipitated favorably with the carbonates while Au, Cu and Pb peak in Stages 3-4 which may have precipitated favorably with silica. Overall, the results suggest shallow hydrothermal activity in the area as a part of a larger porphyry-epithermal system associated to the Bataan Volcanic Arc. The results can also serve as a guide for the exploration of other peridotite-hosted epithermal deposits with similar tectonics settings.",

    "abstract": "Reference intervals are among the most widely used decision-making tools in the medical field, and are invaluable in the interpretation of laboratory test results. These intervals may depend on covariates such as age and sex. The covariate values are often random quantities since they are typically not controlled in reference interval determina- tion studies. When several biochemical analytes are needed to diagnose the same condi- tion, the use of combined univariate reference intervals is not recommendable since the analytes could be correlated. Instead, a multivariate reference region is necessary to take the correlations among the analytes into account. Traditionally, multivariate reference regions have been constructed as ellipsoidal in shape. However, such regions cannot detect the outlyingness of a specific analyte. We propose procedures to construct rectan- gular multivariate reference regions that incorporate random covariate information from the subjects. The reference regions are computed in a multivariate normal setting and the prediction region criterion is used. A parametric bootstrap approach is employed to compute the required prediction factor. Numerical results show that the parametric boot- strap approach is quite accurate, with coverage probabilities very close to the desired nominal value. Finally, we apply the proposed method to real-life data from a study to compute covariate-dependent reference regions for insulin-like growth factors.",

    "abstract": "Earthworms and their gut microflora perform synergistically to efficiently transform organic wastes into useful metabolites. However, studies on the composition and function of the earthworm gut microbial community is limited in the Philippines. Pontoscolex corethrurus (Brazilian earthworm) is an endogeic species belonging to Family Rhinodrilidae (subclass Oligochaeta) that is commonly found in tropical soils under undisturbed native vegetation. This study highlights the structural and functional profiles of bacterial communities found in the gut of P. corethrurus collected from Mt. Makiling in Los Bafios, Laguna, Philippines. Community-level physiological profile (CLPP) analysis revealed that at 48h of incubation, all Biolog EcoPlate™ carbon substrates, except a-ketobutyric acid, were utilized by the gut bacteria, with an increasing average well color development (AWCD) within the 120h incubation. Shannon-Weaver Index (H) value of 3.226±0.053 indicates a relatively high functional metabolic diversity and an even distribution of different functional types. Proteobacteria (42.23%), Actinobacteria (27.85%), and Firmicutes (11.88%) were the most abundant bacterial phyla found in the P. corethrurus gut, based on QIIME 2 bioinformatics analysis. The enzymes associated with the highly utilized carbon substrates in the Biolog EcoPlate™ also corresponded to the PICRUSt2-predicted functions. Overall, it was found out that the P. corethrurus gut bacterial community is genetically and physiologically diverse, with high efficiency of substrate degradation. P. corethrurus gut hosts different bacteria may serve as a potential source of biocatalysts with agricultural and industrial uses. The study facilitates an understanding of the relationship between the community structure and their function in the host and surrounding environment in the tropics.",

    "abstract": "The lack of use of simple nutrition tools to guide nutrition and health workers in educating mothers on proper nutrition is one cause of malnutrition or undernutrition. Pinggang Pinoy is a simple and easy-to-understand nutrition tool developed by the Department of Science and Technology’s Food and Nutrition Research Institute to guide nutrition and health workers in educating mothers on the right kinds and amounts of Go, Grow, and Glow foods on a per meal basis. However, there are areas that are still experiencing the persistent prevalence of the co- existence of undernutrition and overnutrition known as “double burden”. Guided by the Theory of Planned Behavior, the study attempted to determine behavioral intentions of nutrition and health workers to educate mothers after viewing Pinggang Pinoy videos. Through a one-group posttest-only research design, 82 Barangay Nutrition Scholars (BNSs), Barangay Health Workers (BHWs), Daycare teachers and workers, and nutritionists in the cities of Taguig, Pasig, and Makati of Metro Manila and Laguna were surveyed. While sampling depended on permission granted by LGUs and nutrition officers and voluntary participation of BNSs and BHWs, G*Power App software version 3.1. was used and obtained the minimum sample size of 67 with a Statistical Power of 0.86 or 86 percent. Cross-tabulations of background factors with awareness on Pinggang Pinoy, attitude, behavior, control, and intentions yielded positive responses. Spearman’s Rho Correlation showed respondents’ educational attainment was positively and significantly correlated with behavioral intention, and that awareness on Pinggang Pinoy and determinants of behavioral intentions were positively and significantly correlated to intentions. While all respondents except one, had prior knowledge on Pinggang Pinoy, most expressed need for more nutrition education support.",

    "abstract": "On 21-22 October 2022, the PSHS-CVC (academe), Shell (industry), and the LGU Cauayan City (government) collaborated on a Triple-Helix project to conduct a NXplorers hybrid workshop for the City’s research students and teachers. The NXplorers program trains highschoolers into becoming positive change actors for issues in food, water, and energy sustainability. The 106 teachers and students from 18 senior high schools in Cauayan City completed six one-hour workshops and then pitched their ideas forward using video presentations. Collectively, their NXtools outputs were rated satisfactory on the criteria of content quality, technical fidelity, and idea continuity in a double-blind evaluation by experts in NXthinking. This meant that the participants were able to practice what they learned from the training. The participants acknowledged the benefits of the program on their problem statement definition, solutions ideation, social impact study, and knowledge transfer approaches to research. The participants considered how the method used — hybrid workshop — may be improved to bridge the polarizing challenges of the high cost of large in- person workshops and the low knowledge retention in full virtual training. In a focus group discussion, the participants validated the results of post-event surveys that hybrid workshops are a viable training method in situations where people involved cannot easily congregate in one place due to distance or health safety concerns, and yet participants need tactile and real-time experience in using the actual tools for skills enhancement. To get the full picture, they stacked up seven team-based training formats versus quality indicators such as scalability, learning, and retention; and the aggravating factors of complexity, vulnerability, and cost. They decided that small-group coaching is the best method for and hybrid workshops can only measure up when the technical challenges inherent to online training are minimized and audience interactivity is improved. Finally, the results were submitted to the knowledge management office of NXplorers Global for the improvement of the program. In the end, a positive step towards wider adoption of systems thinking was implemented and evaluated to equip high school students with timely and practical research skills and contribute to increasing the number of early-trained social action leaders and solution engineers in the country.",

    "abstract": "Fish-borne trematodes (FBT) is a group of parasitic flatworms infecting a wide range of snail, fish, and terrestrial vertebrate hosts including humans, and infection are common in countries where eating raw food is practiced such as the Philippines. Limited investigation in endemic areas along with misdiagnosis makes it challenging to address FBT infections. Therefore, this study aimed to evaluate the prevalence, identify risk factors, and characterize FBTs infecting some endemic communities in Agusan del Sur and Surigao del Norte, Mindanao. A household-based sampling was employed. Collected fecal samples were processed and examined microscopically, then the molecular diagnosis of microscopy-positive fecal samples was done using standard polymerase chain reaction (PCR) targeting the internal transcribed spacer 2 region (ITS2). A total of 1,152 human and 92 dog and cat fecal samples were examined. Overall prevalence of infection in humans among the sites is 4.1% with higher incidence of infection in Surigao del Norte than in Agusan del Sur (p=0.00). High prevalence was observed in municipalities of Mainit (8.8%) and Claver (11.1%) in Surigao del Norte, where fish is popularly eaten raw or undercooked (as kinilaw and sugba). Males were found to be more vulnerable to infection than females (6.4% and 2% respectively [p=0.00]) due to social factors affecting the habit of raw fish consumption. Adults have a higher risk than children (5.5% and 2% respectively [p=0.00]), relating to the longer exposure of adults with the parasite. Furthermore, only 2% of animals were positive, all of which are dogs. Molecular findings revealed the following species: Haplorchis taichui, Stellenthchasmus falcatus, and Opisthorchis viverrini. This is the first molecular research on FBTs in the country. This study identified susceptible groups and underlying risk factors, and utilized more accurate diagnostic tools to help take steps forward in breaking the cycle of infection through providing specific areas for a more targeted FBT control.",

    "abstract": "Robust understanding of the connection between galaxies and the dark matter (DM) halos that host them is achieved using modern hydrodynamic simulations. However, such simulations are generally computation-intensive and require a lot of computing time. In this study, we develop machine learning (ML) models to map baryonic properties of galaxies onto DM halos from the SIMBA cosmological hydrodynamic simulation, at redshifts z = 0 — 2, in a computationally efficient manner. In particular, we trained random forest (RF) and extremely randomized trees (ERT) models to predict central galaxy properties, namely, the stellar mass M∗, neutral and molecular hydrogen masses M_HI and M_H2, star formation rate SFR, and the gas-phase metallicity Z_gas using DM halo properties, namely, the primary halo mass My and the mass of the previous halo progenitors, nearby halo mass densities ρ within r = 300, 1000, 3000 kpc, halo half mass radius r_h, halo spin λ, and halo velocity dispersion σ. Consistent with previous work, we find that the model predictions are able to successfully recover the mean relations between the halo mass and galaxy properties, as well as the intrinsic second parameter corre- lations, such as the fundamental metallicity relation (FMR) with the stellar mass and the effect of black holes in the quenching of galaxies, though they are not able to reproduce the observed scatter around the mean relations. We also study the relative importances of the features in predicting the different galaxy properties.",

    "abstract": "Planting date plays a significant role in determining crop performance since sowing outside the optimal time contributes significantly to yield reductions. The objectives of this study were to determine the phenological, morpho-physiological, and yield characters of five soybean varieties (Ryokko, Manchuria, Tiwala 12, Tiwala 8, and Tudela) in response to four planting dates (March 5, March 25, April 15, and May 6), assess their correlation, and relate these traits to the meteorological conditions during their growth period. The field experiment was done in Santa Maria, Laguna from March to July 2021 arranged in RCBD which was replicated four times. With respect to the phenology, days to flowering, days to full-seed stage, and days from R1 to R6 stage were significantly affected by the interaction of sowing date and variety favoring the second planting. Among the morpho-physiological traits, the number of nodes, plant weight, straw weight, pod length and width, and height of lowest pod were significantly influenced by planting date by variety interaction. As per the yield components, significantly higher responses in terms of the number of pods and marketable pods plant⁻¹, pod weight plant⁻¹, 100-pod weight, percentage of 4-seeded pods, 2-seeded pods, 1-seeded pods, and combined 4-,3-, and 2-seeded pods, seed length, seed width, seed weight plant⁻¹, 100-seed weight, daily production rate, pod yield, seed yield, and harvest index were accounted during the second planting. All the five varieties obtained the highest final pod and seed yield when grown under the March 25 planting. Final pod and seed yield declined as the growing degree units accumulated throughout growth duration decreased, temperature extremely increased, and precipitation started to increase at the later planting dates which might probably be coupled with lower intercepted solar radiation due to denser cloud cover wherein the third planting (April 15) and fourth planting (May 6)-grown plants were exposed. Tudela outperformed the other varieties based on the yield parameters, however, Tiwala 8 was evaluated as the overall most suitable genotype based on several criteria for vegetable soybean close-to-ideal plant type and surpassed the true vegetable soybean variety (Ryokko). Prevailing weather conditions coinciding the soybean growth potentially influenced the length of time to achieve flowering and to reach the full-seed stage which is ready for harvesting of fresh green pods. The major determinants of yield were pod and seed weight plant⁻¹ (r = 0.96 to 0.99), days to R6 stage (r = 0.90 to 0.95), and number of pods plant⁻¹ (r = 0.86 to 0.93), whereas harvest index were strongly associated with pod and seed size. Appropriate timing of planting should be discerned to effectively limit the concurring environmental stresses, hence, achieving favorably higher yield.",

Copper source did not affect growth performance, small intestine morphology, and the gene expressions of insulin-like growth factor 1 and occludin. In conclusion, zinc oxide + copper sulfate combination has an effect in diarrhea incidence caused by post-weaning diarrhea. However, in the presence of porcine epidemic diarrhea virus, copper source or antibiotic was unable to reduce diarrhea incidence. Regardless of the method to determine fecal color and the copper source, nursery pigs fed diets with pharmacological levels of copper have darker color.",

This study sought to evaluate the morpho-physiology, yield, and seed quality of six soybean genotypes sown under four planting dates. The experiment was conducted under Bukidnon conditions in a randomized complete block design (RCBD) with four replicates. Results of this study revealed significant interaction effects (P<0.05) between planting dates and genotypes across all parameters tested except for the seed moisture content. Planting in May 2022 significantly extended the phenological stages (R1 and R6) which resulted in an increase in the accumulation of GDD. May 2022 planting was characterized by higher growth temperature, high rainfall intensity, and longer photoperiod compared to other planting dates. Longer duration of phenological stages resulted to an increase in plant height, number of nodes plant⁻¹ and plant biomass which had major implications on yield of vegetable soybeans. Green pod yield ha⁻¹ in AGS 374, Manchuria, Ryokko, and Tiwala 12 was significantly increased when planted both in September 2021 and May 2022 while Tiwala 8 has only increased its yield when planted in the latter. Green pod yield of Tudela Black was only on decline when sown in November 2021. Consequently, May 2022 planting decreased the amount of oil while total protein and total sugar were highly variable across planting dates. Pearson correlation analysis revealed that green pod yield was positively correlated to the number of pods plant⁻¹, and plant height at harvest consistent across genotypes. For optimum vegetable soybean production, planting starting from May to September can potentially improve yield and seed quality. The results of this study may aid growers in the Philippines in the selection of appropriate planting date intended to optimize vegetable soybean production.",

Low level of heavy metals was observed in the fresh seaweed sample (Cd: 0.209 μg/g, Pb: 1.40 μg/g) in relation to the standard limit of WHO, USNRC and EU. Although a slight increase in arsenic was observed (3.75 μg/g) in seaweeds where 3 mg/kg and 2 mg/kg were the standard limit according to WHO and EU regulations, respectively. Proximate analysis of fresh seaweed showed nutrient content of 34.59% ash, 8.02% crude protein, 10.56% crude fiber, 0.63% crude fat and 46.20% NFE. After the seaweed was subjected to fermentation using molasses and different inoculants, its nutritional content declined except for the NFE which showed increased value. The treatments that were used in the study were as follows: Treatment 1: seaweed and molasses (no inoculant), Treatment 2: Lactobacillus plantarum S20 at Iml/L with 1x10⁹ cfu (Campbell, et. al., 2020), Treatment 3: with yeast at 30g/L at 1.2 x 10⁸ cfu and Treatment 4: 50% Lactobacillus plantarum $20:50% yeast. A significant difference was observed in the fermented seaweed in terms of crude protein and crude fiber. The highest value for fermented seaweeds in terms of CP and CF appeared to be treatment 3 showing contents of 13.68% ash, 7.38% Cp, 4.86% CF, 0.06% CFat and 74.01% NFE. During the feeding trial, a significant decline (p-value = 0.028) in the bodyweight (10.008 kg) was observed in the first week of inclusion of the treatment, although the following week showed that the animal started to gain weight after 2 weeks of continued supplementation with the treatment. Blood analysis showed significant differences in terms of duration of feeding for RBC, tWBC and PCV. Total RBC and PCV counts showed decreasing trend while remaining in the normal range. The tWBC count of the animal that appeared to be in the maximum normal range greatly increased after the first week of supplementation and showed a slow decline after week 2. Treatment 2 showed elevated levels of neutrophil and dropped to below minimum in terms of lymphocytes. Treatment 3, although falling outside the normal range appeared to be near normal compared to the level shown by Treatment 2. However, these changes may not be solely attributed to the treatments since the animals also exhibited respiratory symptoms during supplementation. Further studies regarding the effect of supplementation in terms of the growth of the animal is proposed in order to determine the potential of the supplementation. A longer feeding trial is also recommended to be able to determine the effect on the body weight of the animal as well as the long-term effect of the feed containing low-level heavy metal supplement.",

    "abstract": "This study aims to develop a readiness model to assess the levels of readiness of the crops and livestock R&D organizations in the Philippines, toward Agriculture 4.0, with focus on human capital development. An exploratory sequential mixed method research design was employed in the development of the readiness tool. The qualitative phase entailed desk research, real-time (RT) Delphi Technique, and key informant interviews (KII). The model was administered during the quantitative phase, through online survey covering research and development organizations in the Philippines, and subsequently validated through Confirmatory Factor Analysis (CFA) and Structural Equation Modeling (SEM). Readiness levels of each organization were determined for policy reforms on capability development, particularly focusing on education and training. Agriculture 4.0 in the context of Philippine R&D covers the concepts and technologies of 4IR used to enhance and develop agriculture innovations and systems across the agri-food value chain that will improve agriculture productivity, environmental sustainability, food and nutrition, and income. Frontier technologies include biotechnology, sensors and remote sensing technologies, Artificial Intelligence (AI) and machine learning, advance genomics and gene editing, nanotechnology, 3D printing and additive manufacturing, Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV) or drone, Internet of Things (IoT), Big data, and robotics and automation, and Blockchain. Five basic readiness dimensions for Agriculture 4.0 namely (1) Human Capital, (2) Organizational Leadership, (3) Strategy and Skills Development, (4) Smart Operations, and (5) Technology Management. To validate the said readiness model, a second order factor analysis was done. Construct validity, convergent validity, and discriminant validity were performed using the SPSS program Amos. After achieving model fit and establishing regression coefficients significantly related to agriculture readiness, which indicated that the model developed is valid and reliable. Based on this, the R&D community is still at the Level 2 readiness or conceptualization stage with some organizations reaching the co-creation level. Among the readiness dimensions, the human capital was able to obtain a relatively higher readiness level (3). Meanwhile, strategy and skills development, and smart operations were able to garner the lowest level of readiness (awareness). Competencies related to biotechnology, sensors and remote sensing, oT, big data and AUVs were considered priority areas for human capital investments. While digital literacy skills are needed by the current workforce, these need to be complemented by social and personal skills to be ready for the Agriculture 4.0.",

The barangay being the most direct link to the community, has the responsibility to manage nutrition challenges, through the guidance of the BNCCs. The study aimed to determine the association of knowledge, self-efficacy, and practices (KSP) on NPM of the BNCCs in Quezon Province, Philippines. The study also determined the demographic characteristics associated with the KSP on NPM of BNCCs. Across 307 BNCCs interviewed, results showed significant weak associations between knowledge and self-efficacy (ρ=0.1994, ρ=0.0004), knowledge and practice (ρ=0.1687, ρ=0.0030), and self-efficacy and practice (ρ=0.1710, ρ=0.0026). Results of regression analysis showed that age and educational attainment were not significantly associated with KSP on NPM. However, sex had a weak significant association with knowledge scores (rₚᵦ=-0.127, ρ=0.026), with females being 2.54 times more likely to have high knowledge levels compared to males. Moreover, years in service had a weak significant association with self-efficacy (ρ=0.059, ρ=0.002) and practice (ρ=0.132, ρ=0.021), indicating that longer service correlates with higher self-efficacy and practice scores. Training attendance also showed weak significant associations: nutrition training was linked to higher self-efficacy (rₚᵦ=0.127, ρ=0.026) and practice (rₚᵦ=-0.300, ρ<0.001), and nutrition program management training was linked to practice (rₚᵦ=-0.215, ρ<0.001).

Recently, protozoan infections initially restricted to animals, such as babesiosis (Babesia sp.), theileriosis (Theileria sp.), and surra (Trypanosoma evansi) have been reported in humans. In this study, the potential role of tabanids in the transmission of zoonotic parasites such as Babesia sp., Theileria sp, and Tr. evansi was determined through molecular approaches. A cross-sectional, descriptive design was used in the study. Nzi traps and carabao- baited traps were installed near backyard farms in Brgy. Catalanacan, Science City of Mufioz, Nueva Ecija for the collection of tabanids. The species, relative abundance and density of the collected tabanids were recorded. The occurrence of Trypanosoma evansi (n = 383) and Theileria/Babesia sp. (n = 382) in the proboscis of tabanids were determined using molecular techniques. The presence of human blood among the samples positive for the target protozoans was also determined as an indicator of human blood feeding by the tabanids. A total of 4,321 tabanids were collected belonging to the genus Tabanus, 99.95% of which were Ta. partitus while 0.05% were Ta. reducens. Using polymerase chain reaction (PCR), the occurrences for Jr. evansi and Theileria/Babesia sp. were 47.26% (n = 181) and 31.15% (n = 119), respectively. The co-occurrence of the parasites was detected in 6.01% (n = 23) of the proboscis. Twelve samples found positive for Theileria/Babesia sp. were subjected to sequencing and found to be from the genus Theileria. About 18.41% (n= 51) of the samples positive for either or both protozoans have detectable human blood. The results indicate that humans could become exposed to 7x evansi, Babesia sp., and Theileria sp. through tabanid bites.",

    "abstract": "Using an explanatory-sequential mixed-methods approach, this dissertation examines the interrelationships among body image perception, skin-lightening practices, and mental health in a cohort of 3,127 emerging Filipino adults. Quantitative data, analyzed through generalized structural equation modeling, revealed that positive body image significantly predicts better mental health outcomes. Higher scores on body appreciation and esteem scales were linked to lower incidences of depression, anxiety, and stress. The study also found that body image perceptions influence skin-lightening practices, with a greater understanding of the active ingredients in skin-lightening products (SLPs) associated with a more positive body image. This suggests educational interventions could improve body image perception and reduce reliance on SLPs. Qualitative insights among 16 informants highlight significant societal pressures and the impact of media portrayals of beauty standards, exacerbating mental health challenges, especially among young women. These pressures often lead to higher levels of anxiety and depression associated with negative body image. The concept of body politics, which refers to how societal powers regulate the human body, plays a crucial role in sustaining the white beauty standard influenced by historical colonialism and perpetuated by contemporary media and societal norms. This dissertation adds to body image literature by providing specific insights into the Filipino context, where Western beauty standards heavily shape local perceptions. Unlike previous studies focusing predominantly on Western populations, this research sheds light on the impact of global beauty standards on mental health in an Asian post-colonial society. The mixed-method approach offers a comprehensive understanding by combining statistical associations with personal narratives, revealing cultural nuances that influence body image and mental health. Building on existing theories, such as the Sociocultural Theory, this study proposes the Culturally Informed Body Image Theory, emphasizing the importance of considering historical contexts and sociocultural factors in understanding beauty standards. The findings advocate for culturally sensitive interventions addressing body image and skin-lightening practices, promoting mental health resilience and body positivity while challenging harmful beauty norms to foster a healthier perspective among Filipino youth.",

    "abstract": "Hypoxia and eutrophication were evident in Manila Bay during bay-wide field surveys spanning wet and dry seasons. During the wet season, areas with low DO extended northward toward the coast. Near bottom dissolved oxygen levels ranged from 0.12 to 9.22 mg l⁻¹. High nutrient levels coincide with low near-bottom DO. Hypoxia was worse during the wet season due to increased freshwater discharge and stratification. To better understand the oxygen dynamics in Manila Bay, a hydrodynamic and water quality model was developed using DELFT3D. It reproduced wet season stratification, with stratification forming and dissipating in 10-15 days. The model showed lower DO near the coast, particularly the northern and eastern coast consistent with field surveys. In general, higher DO levels were found during the dry season model run. Loading from the rivers affected the DO levels at the surface up to 10 meters, while sediment oxygen demand influenced the DO levels below the pycnocline and near the bottom. The model showed that deoxygenation of the bay is not a permanent feature and can be alleviated with less loading from rivers as well as lower sediment oxygen demand. Efforts to improve the water quality in Manila Bay by reducing the organic and nutrient loading from rivers may only be relevant to DO levels, initially, at the surface and upper water layers. The importance of sediment oxygen demand emphasizes the possible time lag of the effects of these rehabilitation efforts due to residual SOD (from old sediments). However, DO/hypoxia clears up in the near bottom waters in ~ 2 weeks with lower SOD suggesting that the feature may not be permanent in Manila Bay. However, hypoxia is likely a recurring phenomenon as seen in the field observations. A watershed model was also developed to estimate nutrient loads coming from the Manila Bay watershed. It revealed that 66% of total nitrogen (TN) and 59% of total phosphorus (TP) came from domestic sources. Agricultural activities contributed 22% of TN and 30% of TP. Densely populated provinces contributed major domestic waste loads, while rural provinces contributed most to agricultural nutrient loads. Smaller but densely populated watersheds like Pasig and Cavite contributed significantly to nutrient loading. The nutrient load model was used to analyze different scenarios for the future of Manila Bay, considering factors such as population growth, urban development, connection to sewage systems, and wastewater treatment. This tool provided a relatively swift assessment of nutrient sources and possible scenarios, considering different options for policymakers and management bodies. The field and modeling studies conducted in this research are a step toward understanding the ecosystem of Manila Bay. The hydrodynamic and water quality model shows how changing nutrient loading impacts oxygen depletion. The spatially explicit modeling of loading sources using scenarios helps to design strategies focused on specific areas where mitigation can be efficient. Although the approaches used have limitations, they proved to be useful for interpreting",

The study involved 462 STEM education teachers who participated in the STEM Education Master Course for Teachers 2021, which was provided by the Department of Information and Communications Technology — ICT Literacy and Competency Development Bureau in collaboration with the University of the Philippines — College of Education through Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs). The sample consisted of 303 female and 159 male STEM teachers. The study analyzed participants’ responses to four instruments that had been administered through the master course: the STEM Education Master Course Survey, which was administered as a pre- and post-course survey, the User Evaluation of the Digital STEM Teaching and Learning Module on “/nformation and Data Literacy for Inquiry-based Learning’, the Data-Based Decision-Making Survey for Teachers, which was adapted from Wayman et al. (2016), and an open-ended narrative survey questionnaire. The study utilized the paired samples t-test to determine whether the pre- assessment and post-assessment of Filipino teachers showed significant improvements in their information and data literacy levels. Additionally, the post-test results of information and data literacy and four other components of digital competence were analyzed using linear regression, while multiple linear regression was employed to investigate the significant interaction between information and data literacy, perceptions regarding STEM education, teacher efficacy, and attitude toward STEM teaching. Qualitative data from seven open-ended narrative survey questions were analyzed using inductive thematic analysis. The results showed a significant improvement in the participants’ level of information and data literacy from pre-assessment to post-assessment. The study also found that digital communication and collaboration, digital content creation, responsible use, and digital problem solving, which are components of digital competence, are significant predictors of information and data literacy. Furthermore, teacher efficacy and attitude toward STEM teaching were found to have a significant effect on the teachers’ level of information and data literacy. Based on the findings of the study, a Data Literacy Professional Development Framework for Teachers was developed. It presents a continuum describing teachers with novice information and data literacy to highly proficient level with the following stages: (1) Teacher Data Explorer; (2) Teacher Data Integrator; (3) Teacher Data Expert; and (4) Teacher Data Seer. The findings and the professional development framework have significant implications for teachers, schools, and policy-making bodies to address issues and problems related to the integration of information and data literacy in the classroom. Specifically, the study recommends that schools provide professional development training and access to technological tools for enhancing data literacy among pre-service and in-service teachers, establish Professional Learning Communities (PLCs), data teams, and appoint data coaches to support colleagues in improving data use practices. Further research studies are needed to explore the relationship between data literacy and other digital competence components in STEM teaching. More importantly. the study suggests including data literacy as one of the strands within the existing seven domains of Philippine Professional Standards for Teachers (PPST) to ensure effective teaching in the 21st century.",

    "abstract": "Most studies focusing on heat strain and cognition were mostly done in high income countries such as Europe, Japan, Australia, Poland, and the United States. The Philippines, on the other hand, lacks information on the impact of heat strain on cognition especially among healthcare workers in hospital settings. With the general objective of determining the association between heat strain score index and level of cognitive function among HCWs wearing PPE at work, the study specifically aims to determine the prevalence of different categories of heat strain score index and cognitive function levels among hospital HCWs in Batangas. Additionally, the study also aimed to determine if there is significant differences in the level of heat strain score index and level of cognitive function when HC Ws were aggregated according to personal factors (age, socioeconomic status, mental status, body mass index, menopausal status), lifestyle-related factors (exercise status, smoking status, sleep duration), non-communicable diseases (hypertension status, diabetes mellitus status), and work-related factors (level of PPE, work schedule, work break duration, and water intake status). This study utilized analytic cross-sectional design to assess the association of heat strain score index and level of cognitive function. A total of 449 HCWs (n=114 from public hospital and n=335 from private hospital) recruited through proportionate stratified cluster random sampling participated in the study. A self-administered questionnaire was distributed by sending Google form link via email. Heat Strain Score Index was used to evaluate the level of heat strain experienced by the respondents while a validated constructed questionnaire was used to determine other factors that affect the association of heat strain and level of cognitive function. To measure the level of cognitive function, PROMIS Cognitive Function Measure version 2.0 (Adult Short Form 8A) was used. Multiple logistic regression was used to measure the relationship between heat strain score index and level of cognitive function while Chi-square test was used to evaluate differences between groups. The findings revealed that only a small percentage of HCWs were categorized under the alarm (11.6%) and danger levels (2.7%) of heat strain score index. However, the majority (57.9%) of HCWs were found to have worse cognitive function than the average of the reference population. Significant differences were observed in the level of heat strain score index when HCWs were grouped based on diabetes status (χ²= 21.8619, p=0.001), hysterectomy status (χ²= 17.1504, p=0.0090), and perceived adequacy of workplace ventilation (χ²= 72.5620, p<0.001). No statistically significant differences were found in cognitive function level when HCWs were aggregated based on personal factors (age, socioeconomic status, mental status, body mass index), lifestyle-related factors (exercise status, smoking status, sleep duration status), non-communicable diseases (hypertension status, diabetes mellitus status), and work-related factors (level of PPE, work schedule, work break duration, and water intake status). Lastly, after holding other variables constant, the likelihood of having worse cognitive function increases by 3.6 times when the heat strain of HCWs was considered in unsafe level. These findings provide insights into the prevalence of different levels of heat strain score index and cognitive function levels among hospital HCWs in Batangas. The study highlights the importance of considering heat strain as a potential contributor to cognitive function impairment and identifies specific factors that may influence the level of heat strain experienced by HCWs. However, it is important to note that further research is needed to explore other potential factors influencing heat strain and cognitive function among HCWs and to validate the study's findings in larger and more diverse populations.",

    "abstract": "Microplastic pollution poses a significant environmental challenge, causing damage to natural processes. Its widespread occurrence is attributed to the extensive use of plastics across various sectors. Effective measures to minimize plastic's environmental impact are lacking. Its extent remains to be evaluated to include risks to human health. Microplastic pollution was assessed by microscopy and FTIR techniques in gut fish samples from Tacloban City market. Data from this study is essential to assess microplastic human exposure. The study chose the top five highly purchased fish in the city, Chanos chanos, Sardinella spp., Decapterus spp., Rastrelliger brachysoma, and Rastrelliger faughni. Results revealed that microplastics are present in all these fish. Among the 25 samples per fish species collected from three major markets in the city, 12±6.5 samples of Rastrelliger faughni, 9±2 samples of Chanos chanos, 8±1.53 samples Sardinella spp. 8±1.53 samples of Decapterus spp., and 741.53 samples of Rastrelliger brachysoma contain microplastics in their guts. Raustrelliger faughni has the highest average number of 10.67±2.9 microplastics, followed by Chanos chanos with 9.67±1.86, Sardinella spp. 5±1, Decapterus spp. 3±0.57, and Rastrelliger brachysoma 2.33±0.46. The predominant types of microplastics identified were tibers, followed by film, pellets, and fragments. The FTIR analysis indicates that encountered polymers were cellulose propionate, HDPE, EPDM, and polyacetal. Various colors and shapes were observed, with elongated shapes being prominent and orange as the prevailing color. Tacloban City Market stands out for selling fish with the highest concentration of microplastics in the guts of its sold fishes followed by Caibaan Market and San Fernando having fish with the least detected microplastics. A KAP survey was done to provide insights into the knowledge, attitudes, and perceptions of local communities in Tacloban City regarding microplastics. The respondents, who were mostly young and educated adults, gained knowledge about microplastics from personal experiences. They had a positive attitude towards reducing plastic pollution and recognized the importance of coastal waters. With a significant number of people who are still willing to consume fish with microplastics, it is recommended to raise awareness about the potential health risks associated with consuming fish containing microplastics and promote sustainable practices to reduce plastic pollution in order to mitigate the ingestion of microplastics through seafood consumption.Future research should explore sustainable alternatives to single-use plastics, conduct broader social surveys, compare microplastics in sediments and water, and investigate the accumulation of microplastics in fish muscle tissues.",

The online version serves not only as an online kiosk for registered stakeholders, but most importantly it would serve as a venue for resource sharing and sourcing. Areas of implementation focused on the uploading and downloading features of the online version, the security of updates in transit, simplification of report generation and submissions, and the platform for communication among stakeholders. PHP was used in developing the front-end and the back-end, together with MYSQL for database. Various open sourced software were also integrated to achieve system requirements like Gpgraph for reporting, Flex Paper for viewing full text files, Sparkweb for online chat, and SWFTools for auto convertion of uploaded PDF materials.",

    "abstract": "This project focused on open source tools to implement network intrusion detection system for DOST. Open source network intrusion detection systems like Snort, OSSEC, Suricata and Prelude were tested and evaluated using open source network intrusion detection testing tools like Pytbull, Scapy, Netcat, Hping, Nmap, Tepdump, Hydra and Apachebench. Installation procedures were presented for the readers to be guided accordingly for future use. Test simulations were done to evaluate the system for its usage, functionality and ability to detect network intruder. Using the selected open source network intrusion detection system’s ability to detect intruder, functionality, rules and database, a system was developed that shows a graphical representations of network intruders. Developed network intrusion detection system for DOST-Bicutan was tested using apachebench for its functionality. As a result, the experience gained from this endeavor can also be used to help other government agencies to review and assess their own network security.  I. The Problem Domain  A, Statement of the Problem  As information systems have become more comprehensive and become a higher value asset of organizations, network intrusion detection systems have been available to the market. Although there are many vendors in the field, each with its own strategy for detecting network intruders, they are too focused on the equipment and appliance they sell. Thus, not all government agencies have enough budgets to purchase that equipment.  Monitoring of a network intruder is rarely practiced in the local industry especially in the government sector. Department of Science and Technology (DOST) as. one of the leading agencies in the field of technology has never implemented network intrusion system in its infrastructure in Bicutan area. With the recent events and the rise of government web sites being defaced by unscrupulous intruders, it is time that the department reviews its own policies, strategies and security implementation in its own infrastructure.  Intrusion detection involves determining that some entity, an intruder, has attempted to gain, or worse, has gained unauthorized access to the system. Intruders are classified into two groups. External intruders who do not have any authorized access to the system they attack. Internal intruders who have at least some authorized access to the  system. Internal intruders are further subdivided into the following three categories \"),  1|Page  1.Masqueraders - mere external intruders who have succeeded in gaining access  to the system and are acting as an authorized entity.  2. Legitimate intruders (misfeasor) - have access to both the system and the data  but misuse this access.  3. Clandestine intruders - have or have obtained supervisory (root) control of the  system and as such can either operate below the level of auditing or can use the privileges to avoid being audited by stopping, modifying, or erasing the  audit records.  B. Background and Objectives of the Project  The general objective of this project is to develop network intrusion detection  system using open source tools that are available in the market. The said project will act  as a monitoring tool to alert the network and system administrators of DOST-Bicutan and  can also be a help to other government agencies to monitor their own network  infrastructure. The following are the specific objectives of the project to:",

    "abstract": "The Courseware Project 2,0 is an enhancement of the current website “Courseware in Science and Mathematics” that will cater new major functionality which is the localized-text translation and annotation of courseware modules that complies with the requirement of Department of Education’s Mother Tongue-Based Multi-Lingual Education (MTB-MLE) policy. The project localized four modules: for Science Grade 3 and three for Mathematics Grades 1-3 for four major dialects of Ioko, Cebuano, Maranao and Tagalog. Testing of the prototype was done by the project proponents using DOST network facilities and of their respective offices. Development of the prototype was done by using PHP, JQuery, MySQL, Adobe Dreamweaver, Sothink SWF Decompiler and Adobe Flash CS4 to address the requirements of the project.  I. The Problem Domain  A. Statement of the Problem  Since the 2009 launch of the courseware website by Science Education Institute (SEI) and Advanced Science and Technology Institute (ASTI) of the Department of Science and Technology (DOST), it served as a repository of the one hundred and one (101) elementary level modules. The current courseware website only caters modules in English contexts which does not conform to the Department of Education (DepEd) policy on the use of local dialect or language in teaching elementary from Grades | to 3.The project addressed this limitation through localization of the courseware modules to major dialects which hopefully would aid the pupils understand better and easier the modules in  science and mathematics. B. Background and Objectives of the Project  In 2004, SEI and ASTI collaborated to develop an educational tool for elementary science and mathematics. SEI provided the content and development of the lessons while ASTI took charge of the digitization. This project is a major enhancement of the existing DOST Courseware project proposal which already been presented in International Conference for Open-Distance e-Learning (ICODEL) last February 22-24, 2012 with working title “Hamessing the Use of Open Leaming Exchange to Support Basic Education in Science and Mathematics in the Philippines”. A major issue discussed during the open forum was the alignment of the DOST modules to the Department of  Education’s (DepEd) Order No. 74, s. 2009 ? dated July 2009, “Institutionalizing Mother   Tongue-Based Multilingual Education (MTB-MLE)”. MTB-MLE prescribes the use of the language learners speak at home in delivering lessons and in classroom discussions and now being implemented from pre-school up to Grade 3 and in the altemative learning system. After some brainstorming and collaborative ideas, it came up with the proposed additional feature of the courseware which is the localization of English context to major dialects by means of localization functionality where the user can do the uploading of  localized audio and localized text materials in the courseware. The following are the project’s objectives:  1. align the website to the MIB-MLE requirement of DepEd; and 2. assist in the development of the Courseware Project 2.0.  C. Significance and Scope of the Project  Aligned the website to MTB-MLE requirement of DepEd - The project addressed the Mother Tongue-Based Multilingual Education (MTB-MLE) policy requirement of DepEd on the current limitation of the DOST Courseware by providing localized  modules available online only.  The network of language experts for this project was organized by SEI and sent audio versions of the modules and collaborated with the users on the context of the  translated modules.  For the localization of modules, only one module from science and two from  mathematics for each grade level for four major dialects of Iloko, Cebuano, Maranao and  Tagalog were translated. User Acceptance Test (UAT) involved six (6) students from each grade level. Overall, ten (10) teachers from different regions, five (5) parents, five (5) children, two (2) members of the courseware development group of ASTI and one (1)  college student tested the courseware project with a registered sixty-nine (69) users.  Testing of the prototype was be done by the project proponents using the DOST  network facilities and of their respective offices.  Assist in the development of the Courseware Project 2.0 — Developed the project version using PHP®, JQuery®, and MySQL’ running on Ubuntw’ server addressing the  requirements of the courseware.  D. Documentation of Existence and Seriousness of the  Problem  In 2004, the Science Education Institute (SEI) seek for assistance from the Advanced Science and Technology Institute for their idea of using Information Technology (IT) in conducting classroom lectures with the plan to optimize, streamline and standardize lesson presentation through the use of cost-effective and high-quality solutions, which would help students to be more competitive, maximize  and enhance learning tools through the use of this technology.  On November 16, 2006, the project “Development of Computer-Aided- Instructions for Science and Mathematics — Modules in Science and Mathematics for  Elementary Schools” was formally launched at Discovery Suites, Ortigas Center,  Pasig City. The event was participated by officials and staff from the Department of Education, Department of Science and Technology, the Media, Teachers and Students  as well.  As of today, about 7,000 copies of courseware modules have been distributed to various public elementary schools, public offices, some foreign guests, science  centrums and lawmakers.'  With the existing system’s feature of providing modules in English language, the translation of modules to the major dialects prescribed in the MTB-MLE implementation would require high budgetary requirement if no other solutions or alternatives will be considered apart from reproduction of the existing packaged  modules for elementary level.  Since the Courseware in elementary science and mathematics are in English language, reproduction in CD-ROM of the 101 modules to translate each lesson to the dialects prescribed in the MTB-MLE would require the following budget allocation  from the government. To compute:  a. Total production cost of 101 modules = P3,242,828.00 b. To translate 101 modules in 12 dialects:  Digitization in CD-ROM  @ P3,242,828.00 x 12 dialects = P38,913,936.00 c. Consultancy Fees for Language Experts  12 consultants @ 1,500/module x 101 =P 1,818,000.00   Sub-total for translation project =P49,818,000.00 Replication @ 765,500.00(10,000 copies) x 12 =P 9,186,000.00 TOTAL REPRODUCTION COST* =P59,004,000.00  * Based on the 2008 actual development, production and replication costs/rates  I. Approach Taken in this Project A. Theoretical Framework  1. Information System Theory  Perceived  Extemal |/  Attitude -eward Behevieral Actual system variables \\\\ i  using intention touse P|] Use  Figure 1. Technology Acceptance Model from http://jeme.indiana.edu/vol13/issue /park.htm (Accessed ‘November 2012)  The author considered the use of Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) shown in Figure 1 that is based on the theory of action by Davis (1986) which deals more specifically with the prediction of the acceptability of an information system. The purpose of this model is to predict the acceptability of a tool and to identify the  modifications which must be brought to the system in order to make it acceptable to  users. This model suggests that the acceptability of an information system is  determined by two main factors: perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use.  Perceived usefulness is defined as being the degree to which a person believes that the use of a system will improve his/her performance. Perceived ease of use refers  to the degree to which a person believes that the use of a system will be effortless.  2. Systems Design Principles  Systems development initiated  ¥  Investigate and analyze  problem sufficiently to  develop workable solution  ¥  Develop prototype {e-  _——__¥  ut prototype into operation  Refine and modify prototype  Complete component or system  Figure 2. Prototyping process flow  This project was developed using prototyping Systems Development Life Cycle (SDLC) shown in Figure 2 which will it was initially built to produce a model then after thorough analyzing and investigation of the specified requirement to develop a  workable solution, the project was constantly refined and modified.  This prototype model was eventually enhanced iteratively and the system was developed based on the identified new requirements/features based on the testing and  development period.  This SDLC reduced time and costs to develop an information system because changes cost exponentially more to implement as they are detected later in development, the early determination of what the user really wants resulted in faster development and less expensive information system. It also required user involvement and allowed them to see and interact with a prototype model providing them better and more complete feedback and specifications which prevented many misunderstandings  and miscommunications regarding the requirements. B. Rationale for the Framework  There is no perfect system. Therefore, there are always rooms for improvement to every system available. The DOST Courseware will always have future additional requirements that will improve its functionalities. With prototyping, future additional  requirements can be catered by the system.  C. Technologies Used  In addressing the limitation of the system, the project used Sothink SWF Decompiler’, Adobe Flash CS4 and Adobe Audition to accommodate the localization of modules. HTMLS, CSS3 and JQuery were used in order to perform the required functionality for the Courseware modules. The use of these technologies provided effective results for this project because of their capability to accommodate localization of modules. Sothink SWF provided the decompiling of the SWF files to their raw FLA files. Adobe Flash CS4 provided environment for manipulating lines of codes to make this localization made possible. Adobe Audition provided manipulation of audio transition of the localized audio materials. This project used JQuery and its plugins as its JavaScript library since it is already been used in the version 1.0 of the system, The programming language used in the project was object-oriented PHP so that the classes/scripts used in the program can be reused for other applications/system in the future. The project used Adobe Dreamweaver CS5.5 for development  environment. Ill. Project Design A. Concept The Courseware Project 2.0 (Breaking Language Barrier through Localized-text Translation and Annotation) is an enhancement of the current proposed system which  primarily will cover the limitation of the current website that contains modules in  English context only.  Upon accessing the website of the courseware, the user can view details regarding the modules. If the user wants to view the localization module, he/she must  register/login first.  1. Uploading of localized materials  Figure 3. Uploading localization materials interface  For the uploading of localized materials in Figure 3, the administrator added a Language Expert User (LEU) that can upload localized materials like audio, text and module assessment. Each listing was categorized based on localization material type. When adding localization material, localization form contains the module and dialect to be assigned and the input form for locating the directory of the localization material to be uploaded. The LEU can also delete  localization materials just by clicking the DELETE link.  2. Localization of module  ‘THE Days it THE WEEK  Figure 4. Module localization interface  For localizing the modules in Figure 4, the original audio of the SWF file was muted in order to accommodate the localized audio. Localization is available only to the modules that contain localization materials uploaded by LEU. A drop down list box is provided that contains different dialects if the user wants to switch for other equivalent localization.  For the requirements of MTB-MLE localization feature, only modules from Grades 1 to 3 were localized to conform to the requirements of MTB-MLE’s policy of using the following twelve (12) languages in teaching and production of visual and supplementary educational aids: Tagalog, Kapampangan, Pangasinense, loko, Bikol, Cebuano, Hiligaynon, Waray, Tausug, Maguindanaoan, Maranao, Chabacano and Ivatan. Initially, in designing the prototype, only three major languages will be used for each lesson in Science Grade 3 and Mathematics Grades 1-3. However, only one lesson per subject per  Grade was selected to apply the four localized languages of Iloko, Cebuano and   Maranao and Tagalog and that will compose the initial three (3) localized  modules for both subjects. These are:  1 For Science  © Grade 3 - Habitat  2. For Mathematics  o Grade 1 — The Days in a Week  © Grade 2~ Telling Time  © Grade 3 — Interpreting Pictographs  Table 1. Number of Lessons by Subject and Grade  Total Grade/No. of Lessons  Subject One Two Three Science 7 7 z Mathematics 10 11 ll  3. Downloading of localized materials  DOWNLOAD TEST  P)) LUO |  yen EA  Figure 5. Downloading localization materials icon  In Figure 5, registered users can download the localization materials  specifically the audio, text and module assessment. The audio localization is  limited only to mp3 format, the text localization is of pdf format while the module    assessment is of doc format. Localization materials can be accessed and  downloaded in the detail section of the modules.  B. Methods  1. Design studies  Several open learning technologies particularly through web portals became popular to stakeholders because of the free massive resources in the form of videos, lessons, quizzes, tests and curriculum. These include Massachusetts Institute of Technology Open Courseware (MIT-OCW), Khan Academy, Me-Graw Hill Publishing, Prentice-Hall and Camegie Open Learning among others. The content, design and organization of the open learning resources from these websites are  considered during the design of the enhancements for the courseware portal.  The prototype is designed such that it follows the basic web 3.0 standards in terms  of interactivity, layout and functionality.   Learn. Explore. Have Fun,  Figure 6, The Courseware Project prototype  The Courseware Project prototype beta version 1.0 was presented during  ICODEL of which it was designed as it appeared on Figure 6.  It was tested with various actual users such as students, teachers, parents,  professionals and courseware development group.  A user acceptance test (UAT) evaluation form was developed to gather feedback  on content, navigation, functionality, graphics and the like.  The data was processed to gather significant results to assist in the improvement of the prototype to consider the principles of Technology Acceptance Model (TAM)  theory.  ‘The revision of prototype was based after the result of the iteration process and implemented after consultation with the courseware development group of SEI and  ASTI.   C. Process Model  The Courseware 2.0 enabled users to localize courseware modules online and download audio and text localization. In figure 7, we can see the flow on  localization.  Figure 7.

Entity Relationship Diagram   E. Functional and Non-Functional Requirements 1. Functional Requirements  a. In module localization, after the user selects a dialect, the system checks in the database if it has available localization, otherwise, it displays the original English audio module.  b. Before the user can preview the localization, the browser must have adobe flash player installed.  c. In uploading audio localization, the file format of the audio must be mp3 format.  d. In uploading text localization, the file format of the text must be in pdf format.  e. Inuploading assessment test, the file format must be in doc format. 2. Non-Functional Requirements  a. Sufficient network bandwidth is needed to synchronously play the module together with the audio localization.  b. The project is capable of being used anytime, assuming that the user has internet connection.  c. The project complied with the DepEd’s MTB-MLE policy of prescribing the use of the local language in delivering lessons at home and in  classroom.   . Failure rate is expected when the web server of the project is unavailable. Backup of the project can be performed either monthly or quarterly depending on the future implementation and maintenance of the project. Unauthorized access to the system and its data is prohibited. The password is secured by mdS5 encryption.  . User manual is available for ease of use of the system.",

    "abstract": "Emergence of antimicrobial resistance prompts the urgent need for novel antimicrobials. Microbial secondary metabolites appear to be a promising solution to this global problem. Among microorganisms, majority of novel antimicrobials originated from the genus Streptomyces. Streptomyces species are filamentous Gram-positive bacteria characterized by mycelial growth with over 70% guanine- cytosine content in their DNA. We have previously isolated a total of 103 Streptomyces species from diverse soil habitats in Calamba City, Laguna in the Philippines using a modified integrated approach. The isolated soil Streptomyces were identified at the genus level using morphological and biochemical characteristics. These isolates represent a potential and valuable pool of specimen for antimicrobial drug discovery and development research. Therefore, this study aimed to: (1) determine the potential antimicrobial activity of Streptomyces isolates against selected microorganisms, (2) identify the Streptomyces isolates with antimicrobial activity at the species level using 16S rRNA sequencing and BLAST, and (3) determine the evolutionary relationships of the Streptomyces isolates with antimicrobial activity using phylogenetic analysis. Out of 103 Streptomyces isolates screened for their antimicrobial activity, nine isolates showed significant inhibitory activity against at least two test organisms used in this study. Bacteria, including antimicrobial resistant strains (i.e. MRSA and ESBL-E. coli), were effectively inhibited in contrast to fungi. Species level identification and phylogenetic analysis revealed the diversity of the bioactive Streptomyces isolates with antimicrobial capabilities. Results of this study also suggest that soil from Calamba City, Laguna, Philippines may be regarded as sustainable and rich source of antimicrobial-producing Streptomyces. The bioactive Streptomyces isolates may be considered as promising candidates for research and discovery of novel antimicrobials to combat antimicrobial resistance.",

    "abstract": "The study was conducted to characterize the changes in the population of the coconut leaf beetle over time and space, and to relate these changes to the infestation pattern of palms, age of palms, development and reproduction of the pest, and the growth and development of the coconut leaf. Field monitoring of the CLB population in old stands of coconut (more than 7 years old) and young stands of coconut (3-5 years old) was done from February 2017 to July 2018 in Albay Philippines where an outbreak of the pest occurred in 2009. Laboratory and greenhouse studies on the rate of development and reproduction of the pest and of the coconut leaf were also done in order to explain the patterns observed in the field. The spatial distribution of the CLB population as well as the infested palms were aggregated throughout the monitoring period based on the Index of dispersion and Lloyd’s mean crowding. Clumped distribution pattern is related to the percent infested palms, density and age of coconut palms. Development time and reproduction of CLB is inferred to be synchronous with the emergence of every shoot of coconut leaf which has an average of more or less 23 days before another shoot emerged. This observation complemented the laboratory and field biology studies where CLB was able to complete its development from egg to adult in 32.00 ± 0.33 and 34.33 ± 0.41 days and pre- oviposition period of 20.10 ± 0.70 days. On the basis of these findings, the infestation of CLB was shown not to spread even if there was an increase in the population hence, decisions on pest control should not be based on monitoring of infested palms alone.",

The discrete representation of such signals can be studied in terms of fraine theory whosc fundamental result is that: any signal f ∈ L²(ℝᵈ) can be written as a sum, provided that the so-called upper and lower frame bounds exist from the frame inequalities. An exainple of such a frame in the context of time-frequency analysis arc the Gabor frames, which can be constructed by discretely sampling the continuous Short-Time Fourier transform with a single window function on points in the time-frequency plane with some nice structure, an example of such arc lattices. Generalizations of Gabor frames have also been studied. for example, time-frequency systems where multiple window functions are allowed, or when the sampling points are not necessarily restricted to have any structure. These gencralizcd frames can also be adapted to certain properties of signals. An example of such an adaptive system is Dörfler’s quilted Gabor frames, w hich shows that an upper frame bound exists for a system constructed by quilting local time-frequency systems from pre-existing Gabor frames. In this work, we show that we do not need the existence of Gabor frames to construct an upper frame bound for Dérfier’s construction. Furthermore, we prove that our relaxed construction admits a lower frame bound by using density techniques on irregular sampling. This results to an adaptive frame from local time frequency systems. We also use results from relevant sampling to construct other adaptive time-frequency systems.",

Dense multi-species aggregations of dendrochirotes in Bolinao, Philippines were studied at the level of community, population and individuals to gather information on their ecology (e.g. diversity and distribution), behavior (e.g. hiding, emergence and feeding), and taxonomy. Surveys were done using 1-m² quadrats to document the community structure of sea cucumbers, particularly their relative abundance, species diversity, sizes and habitat distribution in three rocky subtidal sites in the western side of Santiago Island. Of the 22 species found, five were cryptofaunal dendrochirotes, namely Actinocucumis cf. longipedes, Afrocucumis africana, Cladolabes schmeltzii, Plesiocolochirus sp. and Stolus buccalis. Apart from C. schmeltzii, these dendrochirote species are recorded for the first time in the Bolinao-Anda reef system. Epibenthic aspidochirotes were rare across sites, probably due to fishery extraction. Overall distribution patterns of species and cryptic ecological guilds (i.e. cryptofaunal suspension-feeders and cryptofaunal deposit-feeders) appear to differ in relation to substrate types, macroalgal cover and proximity to the fish farms, which is a source of nutrient-enriched water. Dendrochirotes were more abundant in the site near fish farms (Site 1, Tomasa Point), particularly S. buccalis which had a mean of 29.5 ± 9.3 ind. m⁻² in bommie substrates. The suspension-feeding behavior, feeding densities and tentacle insertion rates (TIR; proxy for feeding rates) of Stolus buccalis population in Tomasa Point, Bolinao were studied in situ and through video recordings, and compared across different tides, time of day, flow speeds and total suspended solids. Insertions alternated regularly between the large and small tentacles; the latter functions in handling and/or rejecting particles. The overall range and mean values of both TIR and feeding densities were very high, with 7-23 insertions min⁻¹ (mean 15.6 ± 3.2) and 0-80 ind. m⁻² (mean 16 ± 17), respectively. Sampling in the afternoon had significantly higher feeding densities and TIR than at other times of the day. TIR was highest during high tide (16.9 min”) and during flow speeds >5 cm s⁻¹ (16.5 min⁻¹), whereas feeding densities did not differ with the tides and flow speeds. Significant positive feeding responses to the increased particle concentration were detectable at the population level through large proportions of feeding animals, as well as at the individual level through small increases in TIR. The external morphology, internal anatomy and ossicles of the five common dendrochirote species in Bolinao (the subjects of the ecological studies) were taxonomically described to provide bases for their identification, and to identify morphological variants among them. Taxonomic accounts were provided for Actinocucumis cf. longipedes, Afrocucumis africana, Cladolabes schmeltzii, Plesiocolochirus sp. 1 and Stolus buccalis. Additional eight major morphological variants within Actinocucumis (4), Plesiocolochirus (2) and Stolus (2) were distinguished for further studies testing the possibilities of cryptic species complexes or synonymies with better known species. Comparisons with original species descriptions and their synonyms reveal systematic uncertainties that require re-examination of type specimens and a comprehensive review of the relevant genera.",

    "abstract": "The study aims to provide the institution with open academic analytics derived from faculty performance evaluation rating and served as a tool to enhance faculty performance. To accomplish this, the Online Faculty Evaluation System (OFES) was developed using open source technologies which include Php Yii framework, MySql and WampServer applying the Rapid Application Development approach. The system is divided into two main modules, data collection and performance analytics generation. Evaluation was done during mid and end of the semester period with 2,268 as target student evaluators for 72 faculty members. 100% of faculty were evaluated and almost 95% of the target evaluators participated. Performance analytics were generated and immediately made available online to individual faculty and administrators upon completion of the evaluation. Strengths and areas for improvement have been identified and appropriate actions have been taken. Performance of faculty members have improved based on the results of the second evaluation. The result shows that there is a significant relationship between the preliminary and final result. Thus, the online faculty evaluation can be conducted once every semester. Regular implementation of the system can capture more academic analytics to support both operational and strategic decision making vital to further enhancement of quality education. Keywords :Online Faculty Evaluation System (OFES)  I. The Problem Domain  A. Statement of the Problem  The Office of the Head of academic programs is primarily responsible for overseeing the performance of almost a hundred faculty members in PUP Taguig. It has one staff clerk and one student assistant. Historically, the office does not conduct faculty evaluation regularly every semester due to manpower constraints and tedious processes involved in evaluation. Sometimes the data gathered from the said evaluation was not process at all. On the other hand, if faculty evaluation is conducted, it takes semesters or years before the release of the results. The results received and distributed to faculty is already outdated. This has led to obsolete information when it reaches the faculty. As a result, the faculty members were not be Since the result is not available on time, the evaluation result is often not considered in giving faculty assignment which may lead to inappropriate or not suitable for faculty’s expertise. In addition, the head of academic program cannot immediately identify faculty development training programs needed that will address their current  weaknesses as identified in the faculty evaluation conducted.  The Head of Academic Programs(HAP) cannot also immediately assess who will be promoted or recommended if vacancy exists or who will be given a chance to pursue higher education in their relevant field of expertise through scholarship program. There is no analytics from the faculty  evaluation results that can be derived from the existing system due to lack of  staff personnel and manual system to conduct the evaluation and produce  evaluation results of almost 100 faculty members of PUP Taguig branch.  The system addressed the above stated problems and has been an essential  tool that :  1. made easy to conduct faculty evaluation and immediately provide  faculty evaluation results ;  2. generate customized reports and analytics of faculty performance  for the administrator and faculty; and,  3. generate recommendations based on the analytics for decision  making process.  B. Background and Objectives of the Project  The Head of the Academic Programs of PUP Taguig serves also as the Research Coordinator and the Head to conduct faculty evaluation. With the problems and challenges faced by the current manual system on faculty evaluation, the Head of the Academic programs approved for the development of the Online Faculty Evaluation System which serves as software used to come up with academic analytics pertaining to faculty.  The general objective of this project was to provide academic analytics of faculty performance evaluation which will be used for decision making. The specific objectives are to implement a web-based application called Online  Faculty Evaluation System(OFES) by first semester of school year 2012-2013  to capture information and provide reports on evaluation result; make evaluation",

These calamities occur frequently in the Philippines taking big toll of lives and properties. With its landscape consisting of mountainous terrains and coastal areas, distribution of relief foods during calamities is one of the challenges. Down with electricity and clean water, survivors need food that will ease their hunger in the first 48 hours of disaster. The study was aimed to measure the effectiveness of the developed technology in applying foresight strategies in times of disaster. The objective of the study was to determine the long-term future of the developed technology in the deployment of Ready to eat shelf stable disaster foods to address hunger alleviation and challenges of relief distribution. A Scenario Building Approach was used as theoretical framework for the study. The methodology used primary data from interviews, surveys and team discussions while online materials, journals and other studies related to deployment of disaster foods were used as secondary data. The approach started with focal issue identification and environmental scanning on the different macro factors through PESTLE and SWOT analyses. Key predictable and critical uncertainties were identified, characterized, clustered and ranked to establish the key driving forces. Three different scenarios were developed and assessed to determine soundness and significance and were named as follows: Scenario 1 — The Big 3 (TeMaSo) Leverage showed high impact low uncertainty; Scenario 2 — The Admin Influence showed medium impact and high uncertainty and Scenario 3 -— The Indefinite Impact showed low impact medium uncertainty. Strategies were then developed based on the capacity of each determinant to achieve economic growth and development.  1. Introduction  The Philippines, due to its geographic location, is very prone to natural disasters such as earthquakes, typhoons, volcanic eruptions and flood. Preparedness in times of emergency and disaster is very essential for the resilience of every Filipino ( (World Bank, 2005). Our country, being situated along the Ring of Fire has suffered from an inexhaustible number of deadly typhoons, earthquakes, volcanic eruptions and other natural disasters (Masum & Akbar, 2019) Because of its archipelagic nature, Philippines is a culturally diverse country. With its geographical landscape consisting of mountainous terrains, compact forests, plains and coastal areas, distribution of relief foods during calamities is one of the challenges. Down with electricity and clean water, survivors need food that will ease their hunger in the first 48 hours of disaster.  According to the World Risk Report 2018, in terms of disaster risk, our country ranks third among all the countries with highest risks as shown by its index value of 25.14% (World Economic Forum, 2018). Disasters, be it natural or human-caused brought major sufferings to local populations in countries especially in the Asia-Pacific region. Calamities such as earthquakes, floods, and landslides in the Philippines occur frequently (Figure 1.1) taking big toll of lives and properties. Just recently, Mindanao, Manila and Batanes suffered a strong earthquake, and super typhoons “Ondoy” and “Yolanda” greatly hit Manila, Eastern Samar and Southern Leyte. One of the major problems encountered as reported was the difficulty of distributing relief foods and other basic necessities. Any delay in disaster relief could increase the magnitude of distress for the victims.  In a study of Global Peace Index, the Philippines is the most vulnerable country to hazards as shown by 47% of population exposure to different catastrophes (Global Peace Index, 2019). It ranked 134'* out of 163 countries and least peaceful in South East Asia region. The study also showed that climate change can indirectly increase the occurrence of violent conflict through resource availability, livelihood security and migration. In 2017, 61.5% of displacements were due to climate-related disaster (Global Peace Index, 2017).   Figure 1.1 Average Annual Number of Significant Natural Disasters in the Philippines from 1970-2016   ; i i  1970-1979 1980-1989 1990-1999 2000-2009 2010-2016  BFlood #Storm = Others  Source: CRED EM-DAT  During calamities, some of the common relief foods distributed are noodles and rice that needs cooking. Foods in retort pouch in the form of Meal Ready to Eat (MRE) could serve the ideal food during crises. MRE or food aid must be simple, non-perishable or shelf stable, non-bulky, formulation is based on the three food groups (rice or cereal as staple, fat as source of energy, and meat or fish as protein source), and should be safe. MRE pouches should also be sturdy, must pass package tests and standards and should have package design that is stricter than that of a commercial food.  1.1 Objectives  The general objective of the study is to determine the long-term future of the developed technology in the deployment of Ready to Eat shelf stable disaster foods in the calamity areas through scenario building.  Specifically, it aims to: e determine the current situation of disaster mitigation and preparedness in the country  ¢ discuss focal issues and conduct environmental scanning to identify the challenges faced in the deployment of disaster foods in the Philippines   identify and characterize key predictable variables that may have an impact in the deployment of disaster foods  identify critical uncertainties affecting the deployment of ready to eat (RTE) disaster foods  develop plausible scenarios in the deployment of ITDI developed RTE shelf stable disaster foods in 2030  assess the implications of scenarios to the long-tem future ITDI-  developed RTE disaster foods for strategic deployment, planning, technology transfer and commercialization   2. The Problem 2.1 Statement of the Problem  Philippines, being situated along the Ring of Fire has suffered from an inexhaustible number of deadly typhoons, earthquakes, volcanic eruptions and other natural disasters. Being situated in an archipelago, Philippines is a culturally diverse country. With its geographical landscape consisting of mountainous terrains, thick forests, plains and coastal areas, distribution of relief foods during calamities is one of the challenges (Licuanan, Cabreira, & Alifio, 2019). Down with electricity and clean water, survivors need food that will ease their hunger in their stay in evacuation areas. This study aims to address the availability, accessibility and difficulty of distributing relief foods in the calamity areas.  2.2 Specific Research Questions  The following research questions will be used as a guide in the creation of scenarios for the analysis of problem:  e What is the future of the Industrial Technology Development Institute (ITDI) developed RTE shelf stable disaster foods being deployed in calamity areas?  e What are the critical factors affecting its deployment in 2030?  2.3 Significance of the Study  The study will measure the effectiveness of the developed technology in applying foresight strategies in times of disaster. The researcher will evaluate the quality of the strategies implemented during food distribution in disaster areas. The project will identify the strength and weaknesses of the developed disaster food technology based on the uncertainties encountered.  ITDI, being one of the Research and Development Institute (RDI) of the Department of Science and Technology (DOST) undertaking multidisciplinary industrial research and development, technical services and technology transfer/commercialization. It has emerged as a credible and reliable industry and government partner in accelerating growth and development in the country. This project will be essential for ITDI to determine the impact of technology and long-term future plans as an RDI.   3. Review of Related Literature  3.1 Flexible Packaging Industry  Changes in lifestyle resulting from rapid urbanization and income growth have improved the demand for food consumption and packaging styles. The evolution in the development of flexible packaging and high barrier technology brought the development of technology in the market. Food suppliers are now becoming more innovative to cater the demand of the consumers.  In 2017, the worldwide market for flexible packaging climbed at US$ 222.30 billion and expected to reach US$ 317.57 billion in 2026, with an expanding growth rate of 4.1% compounded annually from 2018 to 2026. During the forecast period, the largest region was the Asia Pacific and was also expected to be the fastest growing region (Creden Research, 2018) The demand for flexible packaging is experiencing a fix growth which is mainly attributed to the growing food & beverage, personal care, and pharmaceutical industries among others. With China, Japan and India dominating the market, Asia Pacific is expected to display an intense growth for flexible packaging in the coming year. In the last two decades, technological innovations, sustainability concerns and economic growth are some of the reasons for the remarkable growth of flexible plastics in the US market (Mc Tigue, 2018)  In the forecast period 2019-2024, the Philippine market for plastics is expected to grow a growth rate of around 5%. Some of the factors driving the market are the growing demand from various industries and the increasing government support for foreign investment (Mordor Intelligence, 2019) The packaging application overpowered the market in 2018 and is anticipated to grow during the predicted period. Development of innovative application products is likely to produce a good opportunity in the future.  Flexible packaging is a packaging material that is made from flexible or easy yielding materials in which the shape can be changed once filled. A wide variety of materials are used to manufacture flexible packaging such as plastic, glass, metal and paper among others (Siracusa, 2016).   The developing nations such as China, India and Japan among others are contributing more to the growth of the packaged food industry as compared to the developed nations, due to which the manufacturers are focusing greatly on expanding in these markets for growth opportunities. Consumer demand for convenience, backed by rising discretionary income levels of the working populace has paved the way for the growth of the packaged food industry in regions such as Asia Pacific.  3.2 Retort Pouch Technology  Industrial property has been identified as one of the tools for promoting economic growth by the advance and developing countries. Several countries like Japan are setting policies to stimulate the use of IP protection in R&D _ institution, universities, large private firms, and especially to SME’s that lacks the capability to implement IP management as part of their strategy. In food packaging, the retort pouch technology has been considered as the most advance since the metal can has the capability to become the suitable choice over glass jar. According to the definition, retort pouch is a flexible laminated food package that can withstand thermal processing (Canadian Food Inspection Agency, 2002). Retort food is a retort sterilized non-canned and non-bottled prepared food that is hermetically sealed for long-term unrefrigerated storage (Nishino, 2001). It has the advantage of providing longer shelf life combined with high retention of nutrients.  Through the years, modernization in retort pouch technology worldwide can be seen through R&D on improvement of packaging material construction and performance, equipment efficiency and enhanced packaging technique. Retort pouch technology offers not only shorter process time, but also the advantages of reduced energy consumption and increased nutrient retention of the products.  In 1950s, the retort food technology was developed in the United States for the shelf stable ready to eat meals MRE) intended for the military personnel and space shuttles replacing heavy metal cans with light weight, easy open, easy carry and has longer shelf life foods (Jun, Cox, & Huang, 2006) Although, it was Japan primarily that has successfully commercialized retort technology (Lampi, 1980) Currently, Japan is the biggest producer, distributor and user of retort foods followed by South Korea. During the twentieth century, thermal sterilization of canned foods has been one of the most widely used methods for food preservation and   has significantly contributed to the nutritional well-being of much of the world’s population (Texeira & Tucker, 1997).  Recently, the use of non-foil barrier material with coating of silicon oxide and aluminum oxide becomes the highlight of development in flexible packaging. These non-foil barrier materials are clear materials with high barrier property comparable with foil laminates. These offer the property similar to glass wherein food inside container can be seen and very suitable for fruits with attractive colors. But whatever the structure of retortable pouch, foil or non-foil, barrier property of material will play an important role in protecting sensory and nutritional quality of foods.  Developed countries have been using retort foods as relief/mitigation foods. Retort foods are ready to eat and can be stacked for at least one year. Compared with other packaging materials such as metal cans and glass jars/bottles, retortable pouches are light in weight thus easy to handle and distribute when it is drop from helicopters.  3.2 PTD-ITDI's Initiative  In the early 2000, the Packaging Technology Division (PTD) of Industrial Technology Development Institute (ITDI) of the Department of Science and Technology (DOS) has initiated project studies on developing retort foods in the Philippines. These were undertaken with the objective of developing shelf stable food products in retort pouch thereby increasing the market potential of traditional and ethnic food products. ITDI-DOST has successfully re-introduced retort foods to local producers of canned food products in 2000. In 2002, retort foods such as sardines, dinuguan, shrimp paste, bopis and pork lechon paksiw among others were launched in the domestic market by ITDI’s SMEs collaborators. In 2012, PTD started the project “Application of retort packaging technology in the development of retort foods as disaster mitigation/relief foods”. Products considered in the study are: (1) arroz caldo, (2) corn soup, (3) chicken tocino rice meal, and (4) beef tapa rice meal. The project objective is to develop shelf stable ready to eat retort foods as disaster mitigation/relief foods. The first retort food developed was chicken arroz caldo which is classified as disaster food ready to eat without drinkables. The effect of different rice varieties and ratio of solid to liquid on the acceptability of RTE chicken arroz caldo were studied. The process schedule and appropriate packaging structure were established to ensure product safety. The RTE chicken arroz caldo is shelf stable for at least one (1) year and is now ready for commercialization.   3.3 Technology Foresight  The APEC Center for Technology Foresight defines technology foresight as “Foresight involves systematic attempt to look into the longer-term future of science, technology, the economy, the environment and society with a view to associating the emerging generic technologies and foundation areas of strategic research likely to yield the notable economic, environmental and social benefits.”  According to UNIDO, this method is the most upstream element of the technology development process that provides inputs for the formulation of technology policies and strategies in guiding the development of technological infrastructure in a country (UNIDO, 2019)  3.4 Scenario Building  As defined, scenario building is the process of constructing alternate futures of a business’ external environment (Simpson, 1977). It is one of the tools in Technology Foresight that is very useful in longer time horizons which is around 5-50 years’ time. There are many definitions of scenario. According to Schwartz, a scenario is a tool for ordering one’s perceptions about an alternative future environment in which one’s decision might be played out (Schwartz, 1991). Scenario Planning is identifying a specific set of uncertainties and making assumptions on what might happen in the future of your business venture.  Based on TM 281 lectures of Prof. Imbang, below are the 10 stages of scenario building (Imbang, 2018).  Stage 1. Focal issue identification — This first stage defines the issues in the project as well as the time frame for the study  Stage 2. Environmental analysis — This stage identifies the external factors in the macro environment which can affect the focal issue. PESTLE, SWOT analysis and other related tools can be used to support the analysis of the solutions for the focal issue  Stage 3. Identify and characterize key predictable variables — This third stage identifies the different critical variables that may have an impact on the focal issue and all the factors that can be predicted and controlled.   Stage 4. Identify critical uncertainties - This stage defines the critical uncertainties or uncertain driving forces that may have direct or indirect impact on the focal issue  Stage 5. Clustering of variables - At this stage, the variables and uncertainties identified in stages 3 and 4 are categorized in this stage under more manageable sets or clusters representing the driving forces  Stage 6. Ranking of variables to establish key driving forces — This stage is done to identify the weight of each driving force/variable as these factors affect the focal issue. The rankings are based  Stage 7. Selection of scenario logic — This stage is done by exploring how the different clusters may interact and impact the other clusters.  Stage 8. Development of scenarios — This stage is done to bring about and present as many divergent yet plausible scenarios as possible to prepare for potential risks and gaps.  Stage 9. Assessment of scenario — The purpose of this stage is to evaluate the coherence of the different driving forces, the clusters in each of the scenario to test its validity. Each scenario is assessed using SWOT analysis in order to identify the points which the firm needs to give attention to.  Stage 10. Assessment of implications of scenario to strategic planning — This stage is built on the strategies or critical considerations that may be useful for firm when planning its strategies in the future.  3.5 Technology Deployment  Technology deployment refers to the activities that help businesses in executing available technologies in their current business operations and promoting acceptance and implementation of technologies in commercial utilization. According to Encyclopedia of Multimedia Technology and Network, technology deployment is the establishment of innovations in action that involves the generation of knowledge, install technology and processes to develop systems that will solve problems and available for use (Pagani, 2009)  The term deployment has long been used in military strategy which means spreading out or arrange strategically. In the IT industry, this is an   alternate to the word implementation which means installing, setting up, testing and running. It is the realization of an application or implementation of a plan, idea, model, design, specification, algorithm or policy. In project management, technology deployment is critical in the success of a project (Baskarada, McKay, & McKenna, 2013)   4. Conceptual Framework  Formulating the theoretical framework helps the researcher in analyzing and organizing ideas. It is a way of understanding the different variables in the study on how it will connect to each other. In this project, scenario building is most useful for long-term projects, 5-50 years as discussed in the review of literature. It is the method chosen for this project and supported by other technology management concepts.  Through the 10-stages in scenario building as lectured by Prof. Imbang, this project is aimed to create scenarios that will determine the different challenges faced in the deployment of RTE shelf stable disaster foods (Imbang, 2018). The scenarios developed under this assumption would help ITDI-DOST in doing future R&D activities that can create more strategies in anticipating impacts from different scenarios.   Figure 4.1 Framework Diagram of RTE Shelf stable disaster food  DATA GATHERING (research, team discussion& interviews)  Q  Focal issue setting of RTE Disaster Food  Environmental scanning  Establishing key driving forces & critical uncertainties  Scenario logic selection  Presentation of scenarios |  Assessment  q  | Strategies |   4.1 Definition of Terms  Ring of fire — major area in the basin of the Pacific Ocean where many earthquakes and volcanic eruptions occur  Topography — the arrangement of the natural and artificial physical features of an area  Index value — a measure that describes the nominal value relative to its value in base year  Shelf stable food - type of food that can be stored at room temperature in a sealed container  Retort pouch — type of food packaging made from laminate flexible plastic and metal foils and use as an alternative to traditional industrial canning methods  Thermal processing -— combination of temperature and time required to eliminate a desired number of microorganisms from a food product  No drinkables — food that can be eaten without the need to drink water  Retort food — food processed in sterilized condition making it safe for human consumption  Scenario — a view of possible future environment based on set of assumptions which may affect business or organizational performance  Scenario planning — a structured way of thinking about the future  Uncertainties — lack of sureness about something which is beyond the control of the person or organization  First stage food — the stage immediately after a disaster where there is no electricity, water and food  Resilience — the ability to recover quickly from difficulties  Drought — characterized by water shortage for an extended period of time caused by deficiency of rainfall  Climate change — change in global or regional climate patterns attributed largely to increased levels of atmospheric carbon dioxide produced by the use of fossil fuels   4.2 Limitations of the Study  The study will be limited to the scenario building approach following the 10 stages in scenario planning. This will only create recommendations on the strategies for the future of RTE disaster foods resulting from the assessment of the scenario implications. These scenarios are highly influenced by the different factors including the predictable variables and uncertainties in relation to different factors such as historical background, environment, market and the technology itself. This study will not evaluate other different kinds of foods distributed during calamities, but shall cover only the first stage type of food (No drinkables). However, the technology can be applied to different ready to eat disaster foods.   5. Methodology  The study will start by gathering data through primary and secondary sources. Interviews, surveys and team discussions were used as primary data. Project leader and staff involved in the project on disaster foods were interviewed to determine the current status and the challenges they encountered in the deployment of RTE shelf stable disaster foods. Online materials, journals and other studies related to deployment of disaster foods were used as secondary data.  A Scenario Building Approach was used to determine the long term-future for this RTE shelf stable disaster foods. This approach is used to make flexible long-term plans. Development of scenarios is needed to consider the impact of a technology and to plan for the future. The initial stage is needed to identify the focal issues. After identifying focal issues for the project, environmental scanning was conducted. A PESTLE analysis was presented to monitor the macro environmental factors that have impacts in the project. SWOT analysis was also done to determine the internal and external factors of the developed technology. Below are the different stages used in the Scenario Building exercise.  Stage 1. Focal issue identification  Stage 2. Environmental analysis PESTLE Analysis SWOT Analysis  Stage 3. Identify and characterize key predictable variables Stage 4. Identify critical uncertainties  Stage 5. Clustering variables  Stage 6. Ranking of variables to establish key driving forces Stage 7. Selection of scenario logic  Stage 8. Development of scenarios  Stage 9. Assessment of scenario  Stage 10. Assessment of implications of scenario to strategic planning   6. Results and Analyses 6.1 Stage 1 — Identification of Focal Issue  The focal issue of this scenario building activity was to minimize hunger alleviation and determine the challenges of relief distribution in calamity areas when there is no electricity and clean water. The time horizon that will be used is 11 years (2019-2030).  The Packaging Technology Division of ITDI-DOST developed the “Pack of Hope”, RTE Chicken Arroz Caldo as first stage disaster/relief food. This product was created as a disaster mitigation/relief food to address the immediate hunger of disaster survivors and providers of services (medical, military personnel and volunteer groups) in calamity-stricken areas within 48 hours after the disaster happened a first stage disaster. RTE chicken arroz caldo is categorized as food which means ready to eat without preparation and without drinkables. The packaging both primary and transport was designed to withstand distribution by aerial drop (at least 30 feet high), sea surface, land and water submersion. The developed relief foods can be consumed by everyone regardless of age, culture and teligion. The product shelf life is at least one year and this was validated by the field testing conducted using the distribution protocols of the Department of Social Welfare and Development (DSWD).  6.2 Stage 2 — Environmental Scanning  To support the development of scenario in the deployment of RTE shelf stable disaster foods, the study and interpretation of the macro factors relating to this topic are necessary. Philippines being one of the most hazard prone countries in the world suffering from different types of natural hazards such as typhoons, earthquakes, volcanic eruptions and other natural disasters are facing different challenges and issues such as political, economical, social, technical, legal and environmental.  6.2.1 Political  In times of calamities, the question that was raised for government and other organizations is “How do local government units (LGUs) improve public welfare during disasters?”. In a study presented by Dr. Maja-Leah V. Ravago and her team about “Coping with Disasters due to Natural Hazards: Evidence from the Philippines’, they reported that a one percentage point increase in the dynasty share of a province decreases   the probability of recovery from disaster by 74% (Jocson, 2018) According to Local Government Code of 1991, the LGUs should be at the frontline of emergency measure in the aftermath of calamities to ensure the general welfare of its constituents and be proactive in performing disaster-related activities.  The national government highlighted the importance of disaster preparedness to ensure survival of Filipinos during calamities. Some of the plans and programs of the national government related to natural disasters are discussed below. Programs on climate change and disaster tisk reduction management are critical strategies in the Philippine Development Plan (PDP) 2017-2022. Chapter 11 of the PDP states that the conduct of information, education and community campaigns as well as the mainstreaming of disaster risk reduction in local development is an important strategy to achieve community level resiliency. Building the socioeconomic resilience of individuals and families especially the marginalized sectors through reduction of their exposure to risks and increasing their adaptive capacities is the focus of this chapter for the attainment of “pagbabago” pillar of the PDP 2017-2022.  The National Disaster Preparedness Plan (NDPP) 2015-2028 was created with the objectives that evolve from the National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Plan as amended in the Republic Act (RA) 10121 wherein the primary goal is to avert the loss of lives and assets of Filipinos due to disaster threats and emergencies. On the other hand, the National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Plan (NDRRMP) under the Office of the Civil Defense (OCD) fulfills the requirement of RA 10121 of 2010. It is a plan that serves as the national guide on how sustainable development can be achieved through inclusive growth while building the adaptive capacities of communities. The NDRRMP establishes the expected outcomes, key activities, outputs, indicators, lead agencies, key partners and timelines covering the four thematic areas such as disaster prevention and mitigation; disaster preparedness; disaster response and disaster rehabilitation and recovery (NDRRMC, 2015).  6.2.2 Economic Natural calamities result in substantial economic damages every year. According to PSA, the total cost of damage arising from by “major natural  extreme events and disasters” was estimated at P374.199 billion from 2005 to 2015. The agency gave a separate estimate for economic losses   due to natural and human-induced disasters of P139.748 billion, with natural disasters accounting for P132.910 billion of the total (PSA, 2016).  In the first half of 2019, the Philippine economy remains strong and is projected to grow at 5.8% before it recovers to 6.1% and 6.2% in 2020 and 2021 respectively (World Bank, 2019). Although the growth rate is increasing, Asian Development Bank (ADB) reduced the growth projection for Philippines as shown by its gross domestic product (GDP) rate of 5.5% versus the target of 6-7% growth. They said that GDP would grow at 6.1% in 2019 and 6.2% in 2020 lower than the previous forecast of 6.2% and 6.4% respectively (Asian Development Bank, 2019). According to ADB country manager Kelly Bird, the slower growth rate may be due to internal phase of the Philippines entering in business cycle when growth is expected to be temporarily spontaneous.  As shown in the figure below, the total economic loss from 2006 to 2015 due to natural disasters was almost Php 133 billion. The largest economic loss recorded was in 2009 at a level of Php 45 billion. In that same year, there were 14 meteorological disasters which are considered as major disaster events including the tropical storm Ondoy and typhoon Pepeng. In 2014, the least economic loss was recorded at Php 262.3 million (CPES, 2016).

Around 3.8 million people were victims of Typhoon Mangkut (Duffin, 2018)  6.2.3 Socio-cultural  Natural disasters can cause catastrophic events to Filipino people ( (Jha, Martinez, Quising, Ardaniel, & Wang, 2018). During calamities, one of the most immediate effects is the population displacement. When countries are devastated by earthquakes, typhoons and other powerful forces of nature, many people need to abandon their homes and quest for shelter in other areas. In 2018, around 3.8 million Filipino people are displaced from their homes due to natural disasters and violence (IDMC, 2018) A large number of evacuees can derange the accessibility of health care as well as food supplies and clean water. Another social issue of natural disasters is the risks of health. People staying in evacuation areas where there is no supply of clean water and food can accelerate death tolls even after the immediate has passed (Figure 6.2.3.1).

People devastated by typhoons or severe drought can go hungry as a result of destroyed crops and loss of agricultural supplies. Hunger and availability of food are   some of the critical issues experienced by calamity survivors. The frequent disasters hinder the Philippine Government's efforts to reduce the incidence of poverty and reduce the number of people and assets vulnerable to these hazards. There are manifestations of close association between poverty and vulnerability to natural disasters and of their combined re-enforcing effects. As a result, the poorer communities tend to be the most vulnerable.  6.2.4 Technological  In aligning to national goals and plans, the Department of Science and Technology (DOST) through its Strategic Plan 2017-2022 aspires to use science to enhance innovation and creative capacity of the Filipinos toward the achievement of inclusive and sustainable development. The Science for the people 11-point agenda which include providing science technology and innovation (STI) based solutions for disaster risks and climate change adaptation (DOST, 2017) The importance of monitoring and forecasting hazard and risk assessment, risk communication and appropriate response during and after disasters is the key action points for Philippine policy with respect to disaster risk reduction and management. During calamities, one of the immediate tasks in responding to disasters is by providing food to victims who are not only physically, emotionally and economically damaged. Being in these sensitive situations, there is a need to consider all factors that would hasten the reconstructing process.  In developing disaster foods, there are many considerations that need to be regarded like the utilities that become unavailable (water and electricity service) up to what extent or duration, and the population in the area. On the other hand, in providing relief foods, there are three stages to go through. This means that at every stage, there are appropriate relief goods that should be given not just for the purpose of feeding but meeting the",

    "abstract": "Immunization has been proven to prevent a wide range of preventable diseases and demise. Different countries, including the Philippines, implemented the Expanded Program on Immunization (EPI) to ensure that children and mothers have access to routinely recommended vaccines against diseases such as tuberculosis, diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis, polio, and measles. However, many challenges have been affecting the implementation of vaccination programs, resulting in vaccination delays and underimmunization. Against this context, this paper applied methods in survival analysis to examine the timeliness of vaccine administration among Filipino children aged 0 to 35 months and its predictors, using data from the 2017 National Demographic and Health Survey. The estimated median vaccine delays among Filipino children were 5 days for BCG; 2.4 weeks for OPV1; 2.7 weeks for Pental; 4.0 weeks for OPV2; 4.4 weeks for Penta2; 6.4 weeks for OPV3; 6.6 weeks for Penta3; 2.3 weeks for MCV1; and 3.6 weeks for MCV2. The Turnbull estimation revealed that the probability of timely vaccination (ie., vaccination within a month after the target administration age) was 67.32% for BCG; 69.17% for OPV 1; 63.95% for Pental; 53.97% for OPV2; 50.40% for Penta2; 39.79% for OPV3, 38.69% for Penta3; 58.72% for MCV1; and 35.64% for MCV2. Semi-parametric and parametric survival models indicate that the child’s birth order, mother’s age, father’s age, membership in other insurance, and awareness of free immunization programs were significant factors of the delay in full vaccination,",

    "abstract": "Type 2 diabetes mellitus, or T2DM, is one of the world's most severe health problems that is linked to numerous deaths and high health care expenses. Novel enzymes involved in its complex pathogenesis have been identified, including 11β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1 (11β-HSD1), protein-tyrosine phosphatase 1B (PTP1B), and mono-ADP-ribosyl transferase sirtuin-6 (SIRT6). In the Philippines, Annona muricata or Guyabano is a commonly used natural remedy for several illnesses, including type 2 diabetes mellitus. However, most of these traditional claims have received few molecular evaluations. This study investigated the phytoconstituents and derivatives of the leaves of A. muricata by evaluating their binding profiles towards selected novel T2DM-related protein targets through in silico methods. Among the 36 parent compounds of Guyabano, rutin, kaempferol 3-O-rutinoside, quercetin, epicatechin, isolaureline, kaempferol, coreximine, and chlorogenic acid exhibited comparable binding affinities with the respective control ligands in all models of the 3 protein targets. A total of 672 derivatives were designed, tested, and compared against the controls and parent compounds in each protein. As a result, 280 derivatives exhibited more negative binding energies than the controls. ACMO021, ACMO14, and BCM008 exhibited the highest affinities with 11β-HSD1, PTP1B, and SIRT6, respectively. Among the potential ligands for each target, ASMO021 is the top ligand for 11β-HSD1 in terms of pharmacokinetic and physicochemical profiles, while HCMO004 is for PTPIB and DSMO008 is for SIRT6. The designed derivatives can be synthesized and further investigated for potential biological effects towards 11β-HSD1, PTP1B, and SIRT6 through in vitro and in vivo studies.",

    "abstract": "The global health pandemic in early 2020 caused a kind of reset in all facets of development. The affected countries, such as the Philippines, were caught off-guard when medical institutions could no longer handle the continuous increase in COVID19 cases. In the course of a global pandemic, poverty was aggravated given the multi-dimensional insecurities that continue to press on the various sectors given the shocks created by the pandemic and the unpreparedness of the Government and the people to address the impacts of the pandemic. The pandemic paved the way to revisit the theoretical underpinnings of Human Security through the perspectives of the older persons in Barangay San Carlos, Binangonan Rizal. This research described the current conditions of OPs in a global health crisis; determined the perspectives of OPs on Human Security and other factors affecting OPs and the community; identified the major insecurities, mechanisms, and experiences which affect how OPs and the community respond to, cope with, and move forward from the challenges of a global health crisis; to analyze the policy and research gaps which are important in promoting human security and social development among OPs; and, recommended policy directions for Barangay San Carlos and the Municipality of Binangonan in Rizal Province. The 15 male and 45 female OPs, aged 50 to 85 years old, who passed the Cognitive Assessment participated in the In-Depth Interview. Likewise, a mix of 16 key informants was also interviewed to provide an overview of the governance landscape during the successive declarations of community quarantines and the pandemic-related responses and initiatives. Further, this research reviewed documents at the barangay and municipal levels. Given the eight (8) dimensions of human security (economic, health, food, personal, community, political, spiritual, and digital), the responses of OPs were clustered and analyzed. Based on the data gathered, observations, and field notes, it was affirmed that OPs had major difficulties during the heightened implementation of community quarantines, mainly when communities were put on “lockdown” mode and restricted their mobility. Further restrictions negatively affected their access to government services and programs and their capacity to engage in economic activities, thus, aggravating the insecurities experienced by OPs. Based on the responses of OPs, eight (8) human security dimensions can be used to measure the level of human security among OPs in Binangonan, Rizal. Using Chi-Square Test, there was no significant difference in the responses between male and female OPs. The overall scores of OPs were plotted based on the highest possible score from the prescribed human _ security questionnaire. This showed that the OPs in Barangay San Carlos were slightly above the 50% passing rate of the proposed human security level. It was affirmed in this research that Human Security is a multi-dimensional development framework that requires a multi-sectoral approach and a diverse set of strategies anchored on Filipino values, human rights, and access to development opportunities. Likewise, it can underscore that recognition and respect for the human rights of OPs were not enough. Together with empowered community-based partners and institutions, the government needs to take bolder steps to address the insecurities that continue to marginalize and exclude the OPs in the development process. The Human Security-based Social Development Framework also utilizes the proposed dashboard and Human Security Index, reflecting the experiences of OPs in Barangay San Carlos, Binangonan, Rizal. This research envisions that the Binangonan LGU can further improve its policy development, planning, and programming endeavors that aim to reduce the level of insecurities and ensure equitable access to opportunities and guarantees among OPs.

These carbonate reservoirs exhibit extreme heterogeneity especially complex pore size distributions thus posing complex challenges in reservoir production and management. Geomechanics study aims to understand and predict these challenges in the reservoir specifically the geomechanical behavior of reservoirs. Studies have been done to develop correlations to further understand the relationship of these geomechanical properties but due to the extreme heterogeneity of carbonate rocks, researchers find it difficult to have an agreement on their findings. To further understand the relationships of carbonate’s geomechanical properties, static and dynamic geomechanical properties were investigated and correlations were developed. Twelve carbonate rock samples from Simpang Pulai, Perak were taken for coring. The lithology and grain type were obtained using thin section analysis. Results of thin section analysis also showed that the carbonate samples have compacted grain arrangement resulting to lower porosity. Six cores were subjected to OYO analysis and triaxial test. The tests determined the dynamic Young’s modulus and static Young’s modulus respectively. The other six cores were used to test for the unconfined compressive strength. The test determined the unconfined compressive strength of the other six core samples. All correlations done between unconfined compressive strength and compressional wave velocity, shear wave velocity and dynamic Young’s modulus showed positive linear relationships. Correlations between static Young’s modulus and compressional wave velocity, shear wave velocity and dynamic Young’s modulus have also positive relationships. However, all coefficient of determination (R²) of the newly developed correlations have lower values with 0.559 being the highest. The error in the experiment due to equipment problem affected the correlation results. Therefore, due to the error in the experiment, all the newly developed correlations will have a large error in predicting UCS and Eₛ.",

    "abstract": "Soil is a rich reservoir of immensely diverse microorganisms with established roles in the environment and potential functions in agricultural and industrial perspectives. In particular, rhizosphere microbial communities have strong correlations with plant health and growth; thus, making them vital for sustainable agriculture. However, the investigation of microbial communities in soil environment is challenging since majority of soil microorganisms are unculturable. This study utilized the culture-independent PCR-DGGE (polymerase chain reaction - denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis) method in order to obtain an initial assessment of the bacterial and fungal communities associated in bulk soil and rhizospheres of different mungbean genotypes under natural field conditions. Microbial community structures and their changes as influenced by plant growth, rhizosphere and mungbean genotype effects were examined through multivariate techniques of principal components analysis and band-based clustering, and through diversity analyses. Plant growth stage was found as the primary driver of community shifts in both microbial groups. Rhizosphere effect was also detected but was less discrete in fungal communities. On the other hand, genotype effect was not discernible although it was not inferred to be absent due to possible lack of manifestations of differences between genotypes based on tolerance to drought under non-stressed environment, and due to detection limits of DGGE. Additionally, the more prominent members of the bacterial and fungal communities were assigned with putative phylogenetic identities through sequence analysis. Bacillus and Arthrobacter species were dominant in bacterial communities in both plant growth stages whereas members of Ascomycota and Basidiomycota were common in fungal communities of mungbean. Overall, fungal communities were found to have higher estimated diversity and composition heterogeneity, and were more dynamic under plant growth influence, rhizosphere effect and uncontrolled environmental conditions than those of bacterial communities during mungbean growth in the field. Thus, the use of PCR-DGGE substantially provided a general overview on the structural diversity and the associated changes in these communities. Since this is a baseline study on the soil microbial communities associated with mungbean, information gathered may be subsequently used as reference for exploring their roles and functions.",

    "abstract": "We propose a model to explain message posting of users in Twitter. Our model, the Co-timescale Cox Process (CTCP) model, is based on the idea of timescales and Cox Process, a doubly stochastic process. We suggest that by considering only the disparity in the timescale, i.e., short and long timescales, of the inter- event time between tweets in our model, we will be able to predict the form of the empirical inter-event time distribution of user in Twitter. We provide a new perspective in modeling human behavior. We avoided to explicitly incorporate factors that are intuitive to influence human behavior in our model. This is in contrast with traditional modeling techniques for human behavior. We demonstrate that more insights can be inferred by not explicitly in- corporating such specific and intuitive behavioral attributes, e.g., sleeping pattern, in the model. We define a truncated power law model as the null model. This null model serves as the baseline of the performance of our proposed model. Since empirical data have been frequently reported to obey power law behavior, we use the trun- cated power law model to evaluate whether, at the individual level, the power law model is still an appropriate explanation for human behavior. Our results show that the CTCP model is able to explain 52.08% of users in the dataset used. In contrast, only 10.47% of the users are explained by the truncated power law. We also considered the performance of both models across different types of user classes based on activity level. We found that most users in the high activity user class cannot be explained by both the CTCP model and the truncated power law model. This suggests that other mechanisms govern most users in this class. Based on the four classes of users, we found that the models perform best in the low activity user class. Lastly, we show that the CTCP model explains exclusively a set of individ- uals that do not possess seasonal behavior and power law behavior. We would intuitively think that it seems impossible for users to have no seasonal behavior depicted in their temporal pattern since we all sleep. The absence of a seasonal signature can possibly be attributed to Twitter influenced shifts in sleeping pat- terns. Various ways of accessing Twitter allow users to post tweets almost anytime which can also be a possible reason for the lack of seasonal signature for some of the users. These results give us insights as to how multiple ways of connecting to Twitter as well as how an individual uses the system itself induce change in an individual’s behavior.",

Here, the pathogens and potential sources (i.e., cattle, ducks, dogs, poultry, swine, and sewage) of microbial eukaryotic communities in polluted sink environments (i.e., Pasig, Marikina, and San Juan Rivers in Metro Manila, Philippines) during the dry and wet seasons collected between December 2021 and March 2023 were examined using the 18S rDNA amplicon sequencing combined with Fast Expectation-Maximization for Microbial Source Tracking (FEAST) program. Taxonomic composition revealed the dominance of SAR, Opisthokonta, and Archaeplastida in the rivers, accounting for 69.7%, 18.9%, and 10.2% mean abundance of microbial sink communities, respectively. Economically and clinically relevant human pathogens from Apicomplexa and Fungi were also found in sink environments including Cryptosporidium sp., Plasmodium sp., Kodamaea sp., Candida sp., Aspergillus sp., and Fusarium sp. The Spearman’s rank correlation test demonstrated that dissolved oxygen, total suspended solids, pH, temperature, fecal coliform count, and phosphates were the important environmental factors driving the microbial eukaryotic community variations. While the presence of indicator species Uronemella filificum and Euplotes vannus in the dry season and Spumella sp. and unclassified Chlorophyta in the wet season did not exhibit significant abundance, their occurrence suggests their potential as bioindicators for bacterial and nutrient pollution assessment in the river system. Moreover, the observed distinctiveness of community patterns between sinks and sources, as shown by the NMDS plot using Bray-Curtis distances, strengthens the effectiveness of the source-tracking analysis. Results generated from FEAST displayed that sewage (19.6%), followed by duck (0.644%) and cow (0.566%) feces, were the major sources of riverine microbial eukaryotes. Spatio-seasonal variations were also observed wherein downstream stations received higher contributions of microbial eukaryotes from source samples than upstream stations, and that source contributions were higher in the wet than in the dry season, indicating the impact of rainfall in enhancing the dispersal of microbial eukaryotic communities.",

    "abstract": "Dugong (Dugong dugon) populations are known to be declining throughout its range because of by-catch fishery, direct hunting, boat collisions, and rapid coastal development. It is categorized as Vulnerable in the IUCN Red List, indicating a high risk of extinction in the wild in the medium-term future. In the Philippines, dugongs are considered Critically Endangered based on DENR’s Administrative Order No. 2019-09. This study aimed to inform the conservation management of the dugongs in Calauit Island, Busuanga through identifying confirmed daylight space use (CDSU) and confirmed daylight core areas (CDCA) of dugongs based on sightings generated from simultaneous land-based monitoring surveys. Four two-day surveys were conducted in 2019 which resulted to 365 dugong sighting events across 30-32 monitoring stations (most manned by local Indigenous Peoples) situated within the Calauit Island Group in Northern Busuanga, Philippines. Using Kernel Density Analysis (KDE), the 95% Utilization Distribution (UD) was used to estimate the CDSU, while 50% UD reflects the CDCA. The total dugong CDSU (95% KDE) was approximately 4.6km² spanning across all survey areas, while the total CDCA (50%KDE) was approximately 0.7km² which represented 15.2% of the CDSU. The nearby islands (hereinto referred as off-shore islands), Dimipac and Maltanobon, had the highest KDE ratio, characterized with a relatively high proportion of CDCA within its CDSU. These offshore islands also have the highest mean sighting duration of dugongs (19.82 min), and calves (22.73 min). Three pairs of mother and calf were seen in Dimipac 2 in May 2019 and in Maltanobon in June 2019. Aban-aban and Elhan 1, were notably frequented by dugongs with 30 and 23 sightings, respectively. Through opportunistic spot surveys, seagrass was observed in depths between 1.5 to 27 m, with deep-water seagrasses (15m) with the presence Halophila sp. observed in CDCAs off Aban-aban (23-27m) and Kawiren (18-20m). Fishers perception survey (n=58) on dugong population in Calauit Island revealed that all respondents ‘frequently’ see dugongs around the island, and that 52 tespondents (89.66%) have seen dugongs ‘several times’ in the past year. Additionally, perceived important dugong areas include Aban-aban (n=25) and Kawiren (n=19). Furthermore, in this study, which aimed to elucidate space use patterns in a relatively small spatial scale, observations of shallow and deep-water seagrass patches off the coast of Kawiren, Aban-aban, Pagdukon and Dimipac indicate the potential spatial heterogeneity of foraging habitats, given the availability of both intertidal and subtidal seagrass beds. While space use fidelity within the Calauit Island Group has yet to be studied, the location appears to be an important dugong area in Palawan with calf sightings indicating a reproducing population. Expansion of monitoring stations within the region could therefore identify interconnectivity of space use and reveal movement and habitat use patterns of dugongs on a larger scale within the regional network. Ultimately, this study has shown that systematic surveys coupled with citizen science could generate useful data in developing conservation",

    "abstract": "The main objective of the study is the integration of the Stochastic Gradient Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (SGHMC) in estimating the parameters of the Bayesian Autoregressive Distributed Lag (BADL) model. In particular, the a priori set for the weights of the BADL is assumed to have fixed hyperparameters, and that is the standard Gaussian distribution. The main theoretical results derived for the proposed model (BADL-SGHMC) are given by: Proposition 5.1.1: the a posteriori; and Proposition 5.1.2: the stochastic gradient of the potential energy (the negative log a posteriori). The results of the proposed model were applied to forecasting the Philippine’s economic growth. In this application, three cases were considered for preliminary evaluation on the behavior of the SGHMC in comparison to other Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithms, namely: Metropolis-Hasting (MH) and Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC). The markov chains in these three scenarios were assessed using Heidelberger-Welch’s stationary test and Gelman-Rubin’s convergence test. The results favored BADL-SGHMC over the contenders in the out-of-sample dataset. Lastly, the paper developed statistical packages for SGHMC algorithm both for R and Julia programming languages.",

    "abstract": "Electroless plating wastewater effluents contain Cu-EDTA complex which has high solubility in water solutions making it difficult to recover copper using readily available abatement technologies. These complexes are destroyed first using Fenton Process producing treated solutions with small concentrations of iron that may interfere on copper recovery. The purpose of this study was to confirm the influence of trace amount of iron ions, resulting from a Fenton pre-treatment, on copper removal, crystallization, and recovery as copper salts using Fluidized Bed Homogeneous Crystallization (FBHC) process. Several process parameters were varied such as effluent’s pH, initial copper and iron concentrations, and metal and precipitant inlet flowrate and molar ratio (MR). The optimum conditions include effluent pH of 6.5-7.0, inlet flowrate of 15 mL min-1, and CO32-/Cu2+ MR of 1.5 with variable copper concentrations of 3.15 — 9.44 mM and iron concentrations of 0.36 — 1.08 mM. % Copper removal was not affected by addition of iron ions while increase in copper crystallization ratio was observed with increasing amount of iron. Superior copper removal and crystallization ranging from 93% — 99% and 80% — 98%, respectively were recorded. Characterization through XRD, XPS, and SEM analyses of the high-density spheroidal crystals obtained allowed the major identification of the precipitates as copper carbonate and its polymorphs, namely malachite and azurite. The FBHC’s ability to obtain high purity spheroidal solid salts enables resource recovery and catalyzes strategies for circular economy practices.  1. Introduction  1.1 Background of the Study  Heavy metals are naturally occurring elements found in the earth’s crust. However, human activities have significantly disrupted their geochemical cycles and upset the biochemical balance over time, leading to elevated concentrations in the biosphere beyond permissible limits(Singh et al., 2011). Copper is one such heavy metal of concern, where its concentrations in bodies of water vary depending on location. For instance, studies in the USA have reported that copper has a median value of 0.01 mg L“', In the United Kingdom, the mean copper concentration in the River Stour was at 0.006 mg L\"! (Donohue et al., 2004). However, these average copper concentrations were found out to be at least four times higher at downstream of several industrial plants.  In typical electroplating wastewater, the concentration of copper could reach 1500 mg L\"! (Ghorpade & Ahammed, 2018). The etching process involving ammonia solution is commonly employed in the production of printed circuit boards, resulting in spent solutions with copper concentrations reported 150 g L\"! (Peng et al., 2017). Stringent effluent standards for copper exist globally, varying from 0.1 mg L” in Italy to 3.0 mg L! in India (2016 Wastewater Guidelines The Zero Discharge of Hazardous Chemicals Programme, 2016). Furthermore, the drinking water should not contain more than 2 mg L” | of copper ions according to the guideline suggested by the World Health Organization  (Sayato, 1989).  Industrial processes such as mining, smelting, surface metal finishing, fertilizer and pesticide manufacturing, and electroplating release heavy metals into the environment through wastewater (Dave & Chopda, 2014; Sabela et al., 2019; J. Wang & Chen, 2009). The heavy metals released into the environment can become bound with sediment, absorbed by plants and animals, posing potential risks to human health. Adverse effects may include bronchitis, dermatitis, poisoning, liver and kidney dysfunction, central nervous system damage, anemia, and mental retardation (Gadd & Griffiths, 1978; Malamis etal., 2011).  Copper, even at trace amounts, is considered highly toxic, making it of utmost importance to treat copper-contaminated wastewater from industries before its discharge into the environment (Ghaedi et al., 2008; S. Yang et al., 2015). Several treatment methods have been devised to effectively eliminate Cu(II) from industrial wastewater, ensuring adherence to the required effluent standards. These techniques encompass membrane filtration, chemical precipitation, ion-exchange, adsorption, _electrocoagulation, electrodialysis, and crystallization, among others (Azimi et al., 2017).  The presence of ligands and coexisting metals is very common among the mentioned industrial wastewaters. These usually limits the effectiveness of current copper removal technologies (Rajoria et al., 2022). For instance, Electroless Plating (EP), commonly used to obtain even metal coatings of copper, employs organic complexing agents like ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) is the chelating agent most widely  used to stabilize the metal ion solution, prevent precipitation of Cu(OH)as) precipitation,  and to control the speed of electrodeposition (Deckert, 1995; Y. M. Lin & Yen, 2001). With this, it is expected that wastewater effluents from EP contain Cu-EDTA. This prompts a problem since complexed metallic ions like Cu-EDTA cannot be easily recovered given their higher solubility in water solutions. Resource recovery technologies based on metallic ion selective precipitation require a pre-treatment to destroy the complex (Q. Wang et al., 2021).  Advanced oxidation processes (AOP) are implemented to mineralize the organic chelants prior to their release. The AOPs are based on the generation in situ of strong oxidants such as hydroxyl radical (*OH) (Ribeiro et al., 2015). The Fenton process is the main AOP being commercially implemented. The Fenton process yields homogeneous +OH from the iron-catalyzed decomposition of H2O2 following Fenton reaction (1) (Ameta et al., 2018).  H,0, + Fe?+ —- OH + OH + Fe** O)  In the context of EP wastewater effluents containing Cu-EDTA, the Fenton process can induce the mineralization of EDTA, thus breaking down the complex (Guan et al., 2018). However, treated solutions contain small concentrations of iron ions in solution that may interfere with copper recovery using available copper abatement technologies(Guan et al., 2018). Fluidized-bed homogeneous crystallization (FBHC) has demonstrated promising capabilities for recovery of added-value metallic salts and nutrients through selective precipitation. Effluents containing one metal that can form an insoluble salt can  be recovered through precipitation in FBHC when inducing supersaturation conditions.  The FBHC obtains high purity spheroidal solid salts, which enables resource recovery and catalyzes strategies for circular economy practices (Caddarao et al., 2018; Guevara et al, 2017; Salcedo et al., 2016; Vilando et al., 2017). However, despite the extensive research on copper removal from wastewater, limited studies have investigated treatment under the coexistence of two different metals susceptible to precipitation (Boonrattanakij et al., 2023; Quiton et al., 2022). This research gap is significant because industrial wastewaters often contain multiple heavy metals, and the presence of ligands can complicate the removal process. Understanding the treatment of wastewater containing coexisting metals and ligands is crucial for developing efficient and sustainable treatment methods.  The purpose of this study is to confirm the influence of trace amount of ferrous iron resulting from a Fenton pre-treatment on the removal of copper and recovery of its salts as Malachite crystals. Beyond the water matrix impacts on abatement and recovery technology of copper, this work explores the impact of FBHC operational conditions. The metal concentration, precipitant to metal molar ratio, inflow flow rate, and reaction pH value showed effects on the reactor’s performance in terms of metal removal, crystallization, and size distribution of spheroidal solids recovered. The results of this work may lead the path elucidating implications of treatment technologies for sustainable management of industrial wastewater.  1.2 Significance of the Study The detrimental health effects associated with prolonged exposure to heavy metals,  including bronchitis, dermatitis, poisoning, liver and kidney dysfunction, central nervous  system damage, anemia, and mental retardation, have been well-established. Among these heavy metals, copper is often found in wastewater at ened concentrations due to its widespread use in industrial applications. As more illnesses are being attributed to metal exposure, particularly copper, it is important to manage wastewater to ensure that it meets safety limits. This research aims to address this concern by improving the quality of industrial wastewater effluents.  By investigating the mechanism of co-precipitation of coexisting metallic ions, this study seeks to evaluate the barriers and challenges associated with solid recovery technologies such as fluidized bed homogeneous crystallization. Additionally, exploring bimetallic salts, specifically those formed by copper and iron ions, presents an opportunity for unexploited niche applications. For instance, the recovery of layered-double hydroxide salts (LDHs) from such salts can offer alternative uses as fine products. Moreover, if proven effective and efficient in copper removal and recovery from simulated copper-iron industrial wastewaters, the studied FBHC reactor holds potential for scalability to meet the capacity demands of industrial wastewater treatment. It can also be implemented as a secondary or tertiary treatment in existing industrial wastewater treatment plants, thereby enhancing the degradation of copper metal.  By addressing this purpose, this research aligns with the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals, specifically SDG 6 - Clean Water and Sanitation, underscoring the importance of achieving cleaner water quality on a global scale (Sustainable Development  Goal 6: Ensure Access to Water and Sanitation for All, n.d.).  1.3 Objectives of the Study This study is generally aimed to investigate the influence of trace amounts of iron ions on the performance of the fluidized bed homogeneous crystallization reactor in terms of copper removal and crystallization ratio as well as the metal salt recovery.

    "abstract": "Addressing the longstanding concern of bridging theoretical learning with practical applications remains crucial in education. To tackle this challenge, educators must embrace innovative instructional approaches that integrate students’ real-world experiences. This study investigated the synergistic influence of Design-Based Biology Education (DBE) on students’ cognitive flexibility, growth mindset, and transdisciplinary thinking. Moreover, it examined how academic resilience moderates the effects of DBE on these outcome variables, alongside investigating whether transdisciplinary thinking predicts cognitive flexibility and growth mindset among biology students. The study was conducted using a three-group pretest-posttest quasi-experimental design and involved 141 senior high school students from a public school in Quezon City. These students were divided into three groups: Design-Based Biology Education (DBE), Problem-Based Learning (PBL), and Non-Design-Based Biology Education (NDBE). The researcher employed a parallel lesson plan across all groups, focusing on empathetic understanding as a critical element in the DBE intervention. Data collection encompassed both quantitative and qualitative methods. Quantitative data were gathered through Likert scales, including the Cognitive Flexibility Inventory (CFI), Mindset Theory Scale (MTS), Filipino Learners’ Academic Resilience Scale (FLARS), and Transdisciplinary Thinking Scale (TTS). The researcher obtained qualitative data from student journal entries, focus group discussions, student output, and daily observational notes. Instrument validation was ensured through expert panels and pilot testing. Levene’s test assessed the variance in mean pretest ratings across the three intact classes on the four scales, ensuring comparability before intervention. Following this, a one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) was conducted on the mean posttest ratings of the Likert scales to establish intervention effects. Significant differences were further explored through post-hoc analysis using Tukey’s HSD, with effect size computed to gauge outcome variability attributable to the intervention. Additionally, moderated regression analysis was employed to explore whether academic resilience moderated the impact of DBE on cognitive flexibility, growth mindset, and transdisciplinary thinking. Subsequently, simple linear regression analysis investigated whether transdisciplinary thinking positively predicted both cognitive flexibility and growth mindset. Furthermore, qualitative analyses complemented these findings, with thematic analysis enriching the interpretation of quantitative data. As a result, an emergent instructional innovation framework emerged from the interaction between independent and dependent variables, providing valuable insights into effective instructional strategies. The results highlighted the significant impact of teaching approaches, particularly the integration of empathetic elements, on student outcomes. Notably, Design-Based Biology Education (DBE) emerged as a potent enhancer of students’ cognitive flexibility, growth mindset, and transdisciplinary thinking. Conversely, Problem-Based Learning (PBL) demonstrated effectiveness primarily in improving students’ transdisciplinary thinking. Moreover, academic resilience played a paramount role in moderating the effects of DBE on the outcome variables, with its influence varying across different levels of resilience. Furthermore, the study explained the positive prediction of transdisciplinary thinking on students’ cognitive flexibility and growth mindset. From these findings, five core teaching strategies surfaced, describing essential elements for effective instructional innovation. These strategies encompassed integrating the design thinking process with empathetic approaches, fostering resilience through tailored activities, promoting interdisciplinary projects and collaborative learning, explicit instruction on growth mindset principles, and adopting authentic assessment methods. Together, these strategies formed the foundation of the emergent instructional innovation framework, offering valuable insights for educators seeking to optimize student learning experiences. Implications of the findings extend to improving biology education by addressing theory-practice gaps through DBE. Moreover, future research avenues could explore the broader impact of Design-Based Biology Education (DBE) on additional constructs such as systems thinking, engagement, critical thinking, and metacognitive self-regulation, all of which emerged as significant themes from the qualitative data. These avenues promise a deeper understanding of how DBE influences various facets of student learning and development. Furthermore, there is scope for conducting parallel studies that address the limitations identified in this research. By refining methodologies, expanding sample sizes, or exploring different educational contexts, subsequent studies can further clarify DBE implementation and its effects on student outcomes. Such parallel investigations would enrich the existing body of literature and contribute to the ongoing discourse surrounding innovative instructional approaches in biology education.",
